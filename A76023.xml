            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,368 texts created during Phase 1 of the project (2000-2009), initially available only to institutions that contributed to their creation, were released into the public domain on 1 January 2015. The approximately 40,000 texts produced during Phase 2 (2009- ), of which 34,963 had been released as of 2020, originally similarly restricted, were similarly freed from all restrictions on 1 August 2020. As of that date anyone is free to take and use these texts for any purpose (modify them, annotate them, distribute them, etc.). But we do respectfully request that due credit and attribution be given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>

            <p>
               <hi>Anſw.</hi> It was needfull he ſhould be God for theſe cauſes.</p>
            <p>Firſt that the ſatisfaction that was to be

               <hi>Anſw.</hi> It was needfull he ſhould be man for theſe cauſes.</p>
            <p>Firſt it was man that had ſinned therefore that nature that had ſinned was to make ſatis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>faction.</p>
            <p>Secondly if he had not beene Man alſo, he could not have ſuffered death, for the Godhead cannot poſſibly ſuffer, and therefore we ſay, that he was Man that he might ſuffer, and he was alſo God that he might overcome by ſuf<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fering, <hi>Heb.</hi> 2.14.</p>

            <p>
               <hi>Anſw.</hi> Becauſe God did accept of it, as if it had beene performed, for he was that lambe ſlaine from the beginning of the World, <hi>Revel.</hi> 13.8.</p>

            </p>
            <p>
               <hi>Anſw.</hi> He is ſaid to be ſlaine in this reſpect, namely in the decree and Councell of God, who had decreed this way, and means to worke Mans Redemption, and Chriſt Ieſus the ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cond in Trinity did willingly undertake, this great worke, and thus it was done with God, and his Iuſtice ſatisfyed, for he calleth things that are not, as if they were, he ſo accounteth of things not actually done, as done, being de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>creed by him, <hi>Rom.</hi> 4.17.</p>

               <hi>Anſw.</hi> He wrought many great miracles he raiſed the dead. he made the blind to ſee, and healed all manner of diſeaſes and taught his Fathers will <hi>Io.</hi> 11.43.44. <hi>Luk.</hi> 7.15.22.4.40.43.</p>
            <p>Queſt. <hi>Was he obedient to the Law?</hi>
            </p>
            <p>
               <hi>Anſw.</hi> Yea he was obedient to the Law and did fulfill it in every thing that it did command or require, <hi>Pſal.</hi> 40.7.8.</p>
            <p>Queſt. <hi>Then he was free from Sinne?</hi>
            </p>
            <p>
               <hi>Anſw.</hi> He did no Sinne at all, neither did guile ever enter into his mouth, 1 <hi>Peter</hi> 2.22.</p>
            <p>Queſt. <hi>Was it needfull he ſhould fullfill the Law?</hi>
            </p>
            <p>
               <hi>Anſw.</hi> Yes it was needfull for us to have ſuch a Redeemer as could perfectly fullfill the Law for us, who could not fullfill it our ſelves, <hi>Gal.</hi> 4.4.5. <hi>Rom.</hi> 8.3.4.</p>
            <p>Queſt. <hi>Then it ſeemes that whatſoever Chriſt did doe, was only for the Redemption of the e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lect?</hi>
            </p>
            <p>
               <hi>Anſw.</hi> It was all for that end, for he was wholly given unto them as the Prophet <hi>Eſay</hi> ſaith, unto us a Child is borne <hi>Eſay.</hi> 9.</p>
            <p>Queſt. <hi>Was he not bound to fullfill the Law for himſelfe?</hi>
            </p>
            <p>
               <hi>Anſw.</hi> The Law was never given unto him
<pb n="11" facs="tcp:116585:10"/> for to be a rule for him to walke by, for he needed no Law, being free from that Corrup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of nature which all the poſterity of <hi>Adam</hi> were tainted and corrupted with.</p>
            <p>Queſt. <hi>If he were free from Corruption of nature, wherefore was he Circumciſed and Bap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiſed?</hi>
            </p>
            <p>
               <hi>Anſw.</hi> It was as himſelfe ſaith to fullfill all righteouſneſſe, not that there was any need in him of the Circumciſion of the heart, or that waſhing and purging ſignified by Bap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>time; but he ſubmitted himſelfe to both to te<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtifie his willing ſubjection to the will of his Father, and to teach us by his example to doe the like <hi>Mathew</hi> 3.15.</p>
            <p>Queſt. <hi>Had he any enemyes, ſeeing he was ſo innocent and blameleſſe?</hi>

            <p>
               <hi>Anſw.</hi> Yes he had many enemyes, eſpecial<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly the Scribes and Phariſes that did perſecute him, and when that time appointed was come, did alſo put him to death, <hi>Math.</hi> 26.3.4. and <hi>Chap.</hi> 27.</p>
            <p>Queſt. <hi>Wherefore did they put him to death?</hi>
            </p>
            <p>
               <hi>Anſw.</hi> There was no cauſe worthy of death found in him as the Judge himſelfe confeſſed, <hi>Luke</hi> 23.14. <hi>Math.</hi> 27.24.</p>
            <p>Queſt. <hi>Could he not have delivered himſelfe, nut of their hands, (ſeeing he was God) and

            </p>
            <p>
               <hi>Anſw.</hi> Yea he could have prayed to his Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther (as himſelfe ſaith) and he would have ſent him more then twelve legions of Angells, but he came into the World to ſuffer and to fullfill, whatſoever was prefigured and prophe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned of him to be fullfilled by him, <hi>Math.</hi> 26.53.56.</p>
            <p>Queſt. <hi>Was his death prefigured and foretold in the Scriptures?</hi>
            </p>
            <p>
               <hi>Anſw.</hi> His death was ſhadowed out in the Paſchall Lambe, and in the ſacrifices, and fore<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>told by the Prophets in very many places of Scripture and that in expreſſe words <hi>Eſay</hi> 53. <hi>Daniell</hi> 9.26.</p>
            <p>Queſt. <hi>Was it needfull that he ſhould dye for to worke the Redemption of Man?</hi>
            </p>
            <p>
               <hi>Anſw.</hi> It was needfull, for he did nothing in vaine, and God would have him to ſuffer death to the end he might deliver man from death, And the Juſtice of God, did require that he ſhould dye, for God had threatned death to <hi>Adam</hi> upon his disobedience, and therefore that God might manifeſt himſelfe to be juſt, and his wrath alſo againſt out ſinnes, and yet alſo notwithſtanding manifeſt his mercy to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wards Man, God would have him to ſuffer a

            <p>Queſt. <hi>What death did he ſuffer?</hi>
            </p>
            <p>
               <hi>Anſw.</hi> They did Crucifie him upon the Croſſe between two theeves. <hi>Mathew</hi> 27.38.</p>
            <p>Queſt, <hi>Wherefore did they put him to ſo ſhame<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>full a death?</hi>
            </p>
            <p>
               <hi>Anſw.</hi> It was ſo foretold that he ſhould be ſo uſed by the Iewes, for as his death was foretold, ſo alſo the manner of his death, <hi>Eſay</hi> 55.12.</p>
            <p>Queſt. <hi>Then the Jewes did nothing unto him, but that which God had decreed and foretold by his Prophets?</hi>

               <hi>Anſw.</hi> The Lord doth it two wayes, in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wardly by his Spirit, and outwardly by his Word, opening their eyes to ſee their miſery, and that there is mercy to be had if they doe repent, <hi>Ezek.</hi> 36.24, 25, 26, 27. <hi>Epheſ.</hi> 1.13. <hi>Rom.</hi> 10.14. <hi>Ezek.</hi> 33.11.</p>
            <p>Queſt. <hi>VVhat is the first peculiar worke that
<pb n="15" facs="tcp:116585:12"/> God vouchſafeth to worke in them whom he hath apurpoſe to ſave?</hi>
            </p>
            <p>
               <hi>Anſw.</hi> The firſt ſpeciall and peculiar worke that God doth worke in them is Repentance.</p>
            <p>Queſt. <hi>But is not Faith wrought in men be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore Repentance and doth not repentance proceed from Faith as a fruit and effect thereof?</hi>
            </p>
            <p>
               <hi>Anſw.</hi> No, not that faith which is peculiar to the Elect, that is never wrought before Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pentance, neither is Repentance a fruit or effect of Faith, but an effect of the Spirit as faith alſo is.</p>
            <p>Queſt. <hi>VVhat Faith is that which is wrought in men before Repentance.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>
               <hi>Anſw.</hi> It is commonly called hiſtoricall faith, the object whereof is the truth of the Scriptures, and it is a gift of the Spirit, com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mon as well to thoſe that ſhall periſh, as to thoſe that ſhall be ſaved.</p>
            <p>Queſt. <hi>VVhat Reaſons have you to perſwade you, that Repentance is the firſt peculiar worke that God doth worke in them whom he hath a purpoſe to ſave?</hi>
            </p>
            <p>
               <hi>Anſw.</hi> I have very many Reaſons to per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſwade me thereunto.</p>
            <p>Queſt. <hi>VVhat is the firſt Reaſon?</hi>
            </p>
            <p>
               <hi>Anſw.</hi> My firſt Reaſon is, the conſtant and unchangeable order, that the holy Ghoſt hath
<pb n="16" facs="tcp:116585:13"/> obſerved throughout the Scriptures, in requi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ring Repentance and Faith, alwayes requiring Repentance in the firſt place, <hi>Mark.</hi> 1.15. <hi>Math.</hi> 3.2. <hi>Luk.</hi> 3.3. <hi>Acts</hi> 2.38. <hi>Acts</hi> 3.19.</p>
            <p>Queſt. <hi>But order in ſetting downe things in Scripture proves nothing?</hi>
            </p>
            <p>
               <hi>Anſw.</hi> But this is more then order in ſetting it downe in the firſt place, for, I ſay, it is re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quired in the firſt place, and the holy Ghoſt doth not require that firſt of us, which it plea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſeth him to worke laſt, but requires that firſt, which he pleaſeth firſt to worke.</p>
            <p>Queſt. <hi>VVhat is your next Reaſon?</hi>
            </p>
            <p>
               <hi>Anſw.</hi> Becauſe, untill we have true Repen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tance wrought in us, we have no right unto any ſpeciall promiſe, for the ſpeciall promiſes of Grace and Mercy, are made only to the Peni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tent and Broken-hearted, and therefore before Repentance, they cannot have faith in any of thoſe ſpeciall promiſes, <hi>Eſay</hi> 61.1, 2, 3. <hi>Acts</hi> 3.19.</p>
            <p>Queſt. <hi>VVhat is your next Reaſon?</hi>
            </p>
            <p>
               <hi>Anſw.</hi> Becauſe no man, before he have Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pentance truly wrought in him, can receive the forgiveneſſe of his ſinnes, for Repentance is required, that men may have their ſinnes done away, and therefore forgiveneſſe of ſinnes doth follow Repentance, and ſo conſequently
<pb n="17" facs="tcp:116585:13"/> Faith doth follow Repentance, <hi>Acts</hi> 2.38. and 3.19.</p>
            <p>Queſt. <hi>But doth it follow that becauſe Remiſſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on of Sinnes doth follow Repentance, that there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore Iuſtifying Faith doth follow Repentance?</hi>
            </p>
            <p>
               <hi>Anſw.</hi> Yes it doth becauſe whoſoever is Juſtified by Faith his Sinnes are forgiven at the ſame inſtant, but no mans Sinnes are forgi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ven, untill he have true Repentance wrought in him, therefore no Man is Juſtified by Faith, before his heart be broken and true Repen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tance be wrought in him. <hi>Rom.</hi> 5.1.</p>
            <p>Queſt. <hi>What other reaſon have you for to prove this point?</hi>
            </p>
            <p>
               <hi>Anſw.</hi> Becauſe whoſoever is Juſtified by Faith is at peace with God, <hi>Rom.</hi> 5.1. But no Man is at peace with God, untill he have truly re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pented, therefore no Man is Juſtified by Faith untill he have truly repented.</p>
            <p>Queſt. <hi>But are not Men firſt at peace with God and aſſured of his love, and afterwards come to true Repentance for their former Sins?</hi>
            </p>
            <p>
               <hi>Anſw.</hi> No certainly it cannot be, for the ſpeciall thing that the party repenting doth ſeeke for is the pardon of Sinnes and peace with God, and to be aſſured of his love, and therefore it cannot be, that he doth enjoy peace, ſeeing it is that which above all o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
<pb n="18" facs="tcp:116585:14"/> things he ſo earneſtly ſeeketh and deſireth, <hi>Luke</hi> 15.18.19.</p>
            <p>Queſt. <hi>Doth not this ſeeking of peace with God and deſire to be reconciled unto him, argue that he doth enjoy peace and that he is reconciled unto God?</hi>
            </p>
            <p>
               <hi>Anſw.</hi> No certainly, for the deſire of a thing, doth argue the want of the thing deſired, and not the having of it and ſo this deſire of peace doth plainly ſhew the want of it.</p>
            <p>Queſt. <hi>What is Repentance?</hi>
            </p>
            <p>
               <hi>Anſw.</hi> Repentance is a powerfull worke of Gods Spirit (wrought in the hearts of ſuch as ſhall be ſaved,) whereby the heart is broken and turned from the pleaſing delights of Sinne, into a great feare and ſorrow for them, and Confeſſion of them unto God, and into an ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceeding deſire of peace and reconcilliation with God, <hi>Luke</hi> 15. <hi>Acts</hi> 11.18. 2 <hi>Tim.</hi> 2.25. <hi>Ioel</hi> 2.12.13. <hi>Heb.</hi> 6.1. <hi>Proverbs</hi> 28.13.</p>
            <p>Queſt. <hi>Is this Repentance that you have here deſcribed of neceſſity to ſalvation?</hi>
            </p>
            <p>
               <hi>Anſw.</hi> It is of abſolute neceſſity as Chriſt himſelfe teſtifieth, where he ſaith except ye re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pent you ſhall all periſh, <hi>Luke</hi> 13.5.</p>
            <p>Queſt. <hi>But is it of neceſſity, that all thoſe parts deſcribed in the definition of Repentance ſhould be effected before a Man can be capable of the promiſe.</hi>
            </p>
            <pb n="19" facs="tcp:116585:14"/>
            <p>
               <hi>Anſw.</hi> This is that conſtant order, which God hath and ever will keepe in effecting this great worke of his, to humble them for their Sinnes, to cauſe them to ſee, and to confeſſe and acknowledge their miſery, and alſo ear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſtly to long and deſire after peace and re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>concilliation with God, which are indeed the very ſubſtance and ſeverall parts of Repen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tance.</p>
            <p>Queſt. <hi>But is not leaving of all knowne evill, and doing of all knowne good the parts of Repen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tance?</hi>
            </p>
            <p>
               <hi>Anſw.</hi> No it is not, theſe are indeed the e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fects of fruits, ever following Faith and com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>monly called by the names of mortification, and vivification, which is a dying unto Sinne, and a riſing to newneſſe of life.</p>
            <p>Queſt. <hi>What reaſon can you give, to proove that this is not Repentance?</hi>
            </p>
            <p>
               <hi>Anſw.</hi> Becauſe Repentance muſt of ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſſity alwayes goe before Juſtifying Faith (as is formerly proved) but this leaving of all evill and doing of Good, ever followes af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter Juſtifying Faith.</p>
            <p>Queſt. <hi>But it may ſeeme, that if that be repen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tance, which you have deſcribed then</hi> Iudas <hi>had true repentance, for he was both ſorowfull and al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſo confeſſed his Sin?</hi>
            </p>
            <pb n="20" facs="tcp:116585:15"/>
            <p>
               <hi>Anſw.</hi> No, he never had that Repentance, for then he ſhould have been received to mer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cy, for although he was ſorrowfull, and confeſt he had ſinned, he never attained that broken heart, nor he never ſought or deſired pardon, and reconciliation with God, for hee knew it was in vaine, for he had ſinned againſt the holy Ghoſt.</p>
            <p>Queſt. <hi>But is not Repentance and Faith wrought both at one and the ſame inſtant of time.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>
               <hi>Anſw.</hi> No, for Repentance is that worke of the Spirit, which prepares the heart, and makes it fit, to receive the aſſurance of grace and peace, which is by faith, and therefore, that which is a preparation to a thing, muſt alwaies goe before the thing, for which the preparation is made.</p>
            <p>Queſt. <hi>But is there any diſtance of time be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tweene Repentance and juſtifying faith?</hi>
            </p>
            <p>
               <hi>Anſw.</hi> There is not any thing paſſeth be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tweene Repentance and Faith, for they do not ceaſe repenting and bewailing their loſt con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dition, nor ſeeking and deſiring after Grace and mercy, untill ſuch time as they be ſatisfied; But where God doth beſtow this grace of faith, he doth alwaies find them Repentant and re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>penting ſinners.</p>
            <p>Queſt. <hi>VVhat is Juſtifying faith?</hi>
            </p>
            <pb n="21" facs="tcp:116585:15"/>
            <p>
               <hi>Anſw.</hi> It is a gracious worke of Gods Spi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rit, wrought in the hearts of ſuch as are peni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tent, whereby they are aſſured of the free par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>don, and remiſſion of all their ſinnes, and of peace and reconciliation with God through Je<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſus Chriſt, <hi>Rom.</hi> 5.1.5.</p>
            <p>Queſt. <hi>VVhy doe you in your definition of Faith adde theſe words (wrought in the hearts of ſuch as are penitent) ſeeing they are not of the definition of Faith?</hi>
            </p>
            <p>
               <hi>Anſw.</hi> I adde thoſe words to ſhew forth the only objects in whom it pleaſeth the Lord to worke this excellent worke of Faith.</p>
            <p>Queſt. <hi>Doth Iuſtifying faith give aſſurance, to the Penitent and broken heart, of peace with God?</hi>
            </p>
            <p>
               <hi>Anſw.</hi> Yes, it doth, as St. <hi>Paul</hi> teſtifieth Ro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mans the fift, and the firſt verſe, being Juſtified by Faith, we have peace with God through Je<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſus Chriſt?</p>
            <p>Queſt. <hi>But may not this Faith bee loſt at no time after the receiving of it?</hi>
            </p>
            <p>
               <hi>An.</hi> It cannot be loſt, but it may be greatly weakned through careleſneſſe, by falling into ſinne, as <hi>David</hi> did, <hi>Pſal.</hi> 51.</p>
            <p>Queſt. <hi>But may they not be deprived of the Aſſurance of Gods love for a time?</hi>
            </p>
            <p>
               <hi>Anſw.</hi> Yes, they may want the comfortable
<pb n="22" facs="tcp:116585:16"/> aſſurance thereof, but they have then, a pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miſe to reſt upon, which is, That whom the Lord loveth, he loveth to the end, and there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore <hi>David</hi> in his extremity ſaid, hee remem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bred the Lords mercies of old.</p>
            <p>Queſt. <hi>But is not the beleeving of a mans ſins to be pardonable juſtifying faith?</hi>
            </p>
            <p>
               <hi>Anſw.</hi> No, it is not, for ſo all men may be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lieve their ſinnes to be pardonable, except they have ſinned the Sin againſt the holy Ghoſt and many have this faith, that ſhall not be ſaved, but ſhall periſh for ever.</p>
            <p>Queſt. <hi>But is this Iuſtifying faith of neceſſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty to be obtained of us in this life?</hi>
            </p>
            <p>
               <hi>Anſw.</hi> It is of great neceſſity, for it doth mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niſter unto us the greateſt comfort that can be deſired, aſſuring us of freedome from the grea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teſt evill, and giving unto us a lively hope of the greateſt good, making all the ſpeciall pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miſes to be ours, whereby wee are upheld in the greateſt afflictions that can befall us in this life.</p>
            <p>Queſt. <hi>VVhat are the ſpeciall effects that doe follow this faith?</hi>
            </p>
            <p>
               <hi>Anſw.</hi> There are theſe foure inſeparable companions, which are the effects of faith, namely, Peace, patience, Hope and Love, a dy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing unto ſinne, and a riſing againe to newneſſe
<pb n="23" facs="tcp:116585:16"/> and holineſſe of life, <hi>Rem.</hi> 5, 1, 2, 3, 4 5. 1 <hi>John</hi> 4.19.</p>
            <p>Queſt. <hi>VVherein conſiſteth the death to ſinne or mortification?</hi>
            </p>
            <p>
               <hi>Anſw.</hi> In the exerciſe of the three firſt effects mentioned namely, Peace, Patience and Hope.</p>
            <p>Queſt. <hi>That we may the better underſtand theſe things, deſcribe unto me what theſe three effects are ſomewhat diſtinctly, and firſt what that peace is?</hi>
            </p>
            <p>
               <hi>Anſw.</hi> The peace which here I meane, is peace with God through Jeſus Chriſt, ſo that whereas before, God had a controverſie with them, now is reconciled unto them, ſo that now they are at reſt, fully perſwaded, God be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing with them, nothing may prevaile againſt them, as it is written, <hi>If God juſtifie, who may condemne,</hi> Rom. 8, 33.34.</p>
            <p>Queſt. <hi>VVhat is the ſecond effect, namely pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tience?</hi>
            </p>
            <p>
               <hi>Anſw.</hi> It is a vertue wherewith they are ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>med againſt all aſſaults of their enemies to beare their injuries to ſuffer and indure their wrongs and though they be compaſſed with a body of ſinne, and many luſts doe aſſault them, yet endure all in quietneſſe ſuſtained by the Word, which ſaith, <hi>In patience poſſeſſe ye your ſoules,</hi> Luke 21.19.</p>
            <pb n="24" facs="tcp:116585:17"/>
            <p>Queſt. <hi>What is Hope which is the third ef<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fect of Faith?</hi>
            </p>
            <p>
               <hi>Anſw.</hi> Hope is the Anchor of the Soule, whereby they are ſtayed and upheld expecting thoſe eternall good things to come, which God hath promiſed to his people, and which by faith they believe ſhall bee performed, and this is that hope that maketh not aſhamed, <hi>Rom.</hi> 5.5.</p>
            <p>Queſt. <hi>Wherein conſiſteth that newneſſe and holineſſe of life, which is called vivification, and the new reſurrection?</hi>
            </p>
            <p>
               <hi>Anſw.</hi> It conſiſteth in the fourth and laſt effect of Faith, namely love, which is the light and perfection of a Chriſtian, which is cauſed by the love of God ſhed in their hearts, and doth extend it ſelfe, firſt to God their Father, and to the Lord Jeſus Chriſt, their Redee<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mer, next to their Brethren, the begotten children of God then to all men, even their enemies, doing good unto them for evill, pray<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing and mourning for them, <hi>Mathew</hi> 5.44. <hi>Acts</hi> 7.60. 1 <hi>Cor.</hi> 13. 1 <hi>John</hi> 4.19, 20 21.</p>
            <p>Queſt. <hi>What is the outward meanes, which the Lord hath appointed for the working of theſe graces in them whom he will ſave?</hi>
            </p>
            <p>
               <hi>Anſw.</hi> The outward meanes is the preach<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing of his Word, which is the Inſtrumentall
<pb n="25" facs="tcp:116585:17"/> meanes that doth beget the Lord adding there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>unto the power of his Spirit, and ſo it becomes powerfull and effectuall for the converſion of his elect, being preached either by thoſe that are allowed Preachers in publike, or by pri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vate Chriſtians, exhorting in private.</p>
            <p>Qu. <hi>May wicked and unregenerate Miniſters convert ſoules unto God?</hi>
            </p>
            <p>
               <hi>Anſw.</hi> No, they cannot, for this is a worke peculiar to ſuch as are members of Chriſt, who only have this power to worke this great work of converſion, having the miniſtery of re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>conciliation committed unto them. <hi>Ier.</hi> 1.23.24</p>
            <p>Queſt. <hi>Why cannot they convert ſoules, ſeeing they preach the ſame word of God that others doe?</hi>
            </p>
            <p>
               <hi>Anſw.</hi> They cannot for theſe Reaſons; Firſt, though they preach the ſame Word, yet is it not by them, delivered in the power, and evidence of the Spirit.</p>
            <p>Secondly, God hath not promiſed his pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſence with them, to make his Word powerfull and effectuall in their mouthes, for the con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verſion of others, <hi>Jeremy</hi> 23.21, 22, 32.</p>
            <p>Thirdly, none can be ſaid to convert, but on<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly ſuch, as by the power of the Spirit in them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves, doe worke upon the hearts and conſci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ences of others, the ſame grace that themſelves are partakers of.</p>
            <pb n="26" facs="tcp:116585:18"/>
            <p>Fourthly, they that convert ſoules, ſhall ſhine as the ſtars for ever and ever, <hi>Dan.</hi> 12.3. but no unregenerate man ſhall have that glory, therefore they cannot convert ſoules unto God.</p>
            <p>Queſt. <hi>Doth the law of the Decalogue or ten Commandements admit of Repentance?</hi>
            </p>
            <p>
               <hi>Anſw.</hi> No, it doth not, but adjudgeth every tranſgreſſor to eternall condemnation, <hi>Deut.</hi> 27.26. <hi>Gal.</hi> 3.10.</p>
            <p>Queſt. <hi>But the Apoſtle ſaith, that the Law was our ſchoolemaſter to bring us unto Chriſt,</hi> Gal. 3.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Anſw.</hi> The Apoſtle intends there the Cere<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>moniall law, and not the law of the ten Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mandements, and indeed the Ceremoniall law did preach and teach us, as a Schoolemaſter, to bring us unto Chriſt, in every thing, and wee may obſerve alſo, that the Apoſtle ſaith, that the Law was our Schoolmaſter, ſo that it ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>peares plainly, the appoſtle intends there the Ceremoniall law, and not the morall.</p>
            <p>Queſt. <hi>But the Law ſets forth our miſery, whereby we come to know our wretched condition?</hi>
            </p>
            <p>
               <hi>Anſw.</hi> Yes, indeed it doth, but leaves us there without all hope or helpe of cure, for it cannot afford us any helpe at all, even like a man that wounds another, and leaves him
<pb n="27" facs="tcp:116585:18"/> for dead, but is not able to helpe him.</p>
            <p>Queſt. <hi>What part of the word of God doth require and admit of repentance?</hi>

            <p>
               <hi>Anſw.</hi> It is the Goſpell that admits and re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quires Repentance <hi>Mark.</hi> 1.1 2, 3, 4.</p>
            <p>Queſt. <hi>VVhat is the Goſpell?</hi>
            </p>
            <p>
               <hi>Anſw.</hi> It is a free declaration of Gods grace, mercy and love for Chriſts ſake.</p>
            <p>Queſt. <hi>VVhen was this Goſpell firſt preached?</hi>
            </p>
            <p>
               <hi>Anſw.</hi> Firſt, it was preached to <hi>Adam</hi> in theſe words, <hi>The ſeed of the woman ſhall breake the Serpents head,</hi> and afterwards to the Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thers and Prophets, and by our Lord Jeſus Chriſt, and his Apoſtles in a wonderfull great meaſure.</p>
            <p>Queſt. <hi>If the law doe not admit of Repentance, to what end ſerveth it?</hi>
            </p>
            <p>
               <hi>Anſw.</hi> There is a double uſe of the Law; It is ſet downe firſt, for the unregenerate man, that he may not deny the puniſhment denoun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ced againſt him, and alſo that it may take ven<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>geance againſt him, juſtly for his ſinnes.</p>
            <p>Secondly, it is alſo ſet downe for a holy and regenerate man both that as often as he lookes upon it (and alwayes he ought to looke into it) he may ſo often bewaile his wickedneſſe, and quake at it; And as often as he calls it to mind (and night and day hee ought to call it to
<pb n="28" facs="tcp:116585:19"/> remembrance) ſo often he may thinke of the riches of the mercy, and of the love of God, by giving him thankes by Jeſus Chriſt, his Lord and Interceſſor, who ſo mercifully hath ſet him free from the wrath of this juſt and holy law.</p>
            <p>Queſt. <hi>Are all the Rites and Ceremonies (which God commanded the Iewes to obſerve) utterly a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>boliſhed?</hi>
            </p>
            <p>
               <hi>Anſw.</hi> They are all aboliſhed, which did any way tipe and ſhadow out Chriſt, which was then to come in the fleſh, <hi>Gal.</hi> 3.24, 25.</p>
            <p>Queſt. <hi>VVhat uſe is there then to us of the Ceremoniall law?</hi>
            </p>
            <p>
               <hi>Anſw.</hi> Yes, it is of ſome good uſe unto us, for therby we may ſee how fitly every Tipe did ſha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dow forth in ſomething Chriſt, &amp; ſeeing it per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>formed in and by him, we may behold the wiſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dome and truth of God, and alſo the obedience of Chriſt to the will of his Father, and we may alſo have the greater Aſſurance againſt all Jewes, and other oppoſers and enemies of Chriſt, that indeed he was the Meſſiah promi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſed, becauſe he fully accompliſhed whatſoever was before ſhadowed out to bee performed by him, or to be fulfilled in him.</p>
            <p>Queſt. <hi>Are we not bound to abſtaine from thoſe meats forbidden to the Iewes, and to obſerve thoſe feſtivall dayes commanded to be kept by them?</hi>
            </p>
            <pb n="29" facs="tcp:116585:19"/>
            <p>
               <hi>Anſw.</hi> No, we are not, for thoſe meats were forbidden to the Jewes, to put a difference be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tween them and the Gentiles, but now the par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tition wall being broken downe by Chriſts death, all meats wholſome and good for food, are lawfull to be eaten, and from thoſe holy dayes, and other like Ceremonies, wee are ſet at liberty by Chriſts deaths; Therefore who<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſoever doth teach them to be obſerved by us, doe teach a divelliſh doctrine, to bring into bondage again the Church and people of God, from which Chriſt hath ſet us free, <hi>Levit.</hi> 20.23, 24, 25, 26. <hi>Epheſ.</hi> 2.14. <hi>Collo.</hi> 2.16.17.20.21. <hi>Gal.</hi> 5.1.</p>
            <p>Queſt. <hi>Did the Lord leave his people the Iewes without ſending any to teach and inſtruct them?</hi>
            </p>
            <p>
               <hi>Anſw.</hi> No, the Lord did not leave them, but ſent unto them his Prophets to teach, and to inſtruct them in the Law and promiſes of God, and to bring them to repentance.</p>
            <p>Queſt. <hi>Did they kindly entertaine thoſe Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phets?</hi>
            </p>
            <p>
               <hi>Anſw.</hi> No, for they being all of them, (ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cept a ſmall Remnant) uncircumciſed in heart, did perſecute them, and put many of them to death, for ſpeaking to them in the name of the Lord, <hi>Math.</hi> 23.37. <hi>Acts</hi> 7.52.</p>
            <pb n="30" facs="tcp:116585:20"/>
            <p>Queſt. <hi>Did not the Lord therefore take away his Prophets from them, and leave them deſtitute, becauſe of their contempt of them?</hi>
            </p>
            <p>
               <hi>Anſw.</hi> No, the Lord, for that ſmall Rem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nants ſake, did not long leave them without ſome Prophet, or holy man to teach and in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtruct them, that they might be ſaved.</p>
            <p>Queſt. <hi>What were the ſpeciall Sacraments which the Lord vouchſafed unto the Iewes?</hi>
            </p>
            <p>
               <hi>Anſw.</hi> They were two, Circumciſion, and the Paſſeover <hi>Gen.</hi> 17.10.11. <hi>Exod.</hi> 12.</p>
            <p>Queſt. <hi>What did Circumciſion teach them?</hi>
            </p>
            <p>
               <hi>Anſw.</hi> Circumciſion did teach and preach unto them the Circumciſion of the heart, which Circumciſion of the heart God did eſpe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cially require and call for. <hi>Ier.</hi> 4.4. <hi>Rom.</hi> 2.28.</p>
            <p>Queſt. <hi>What was ſignified by the Paſſeover?</hi>
            </p>
            <p>
               <hi>Anſw.</hi> Chriſt Jeſus, who was indeed the true Paſchall Lambe, the ſubſtance of that Ceremo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny who was in fulneſſe of time to be ſacrificed for them, <hi>Gal.</hi> 44. 1 <hi>Cor.</hi> 57.</p>
            <p>Queſt. <hi>Then it ſeemes that all thoſe Rites and Ceremonies had a ſpirituall intent and ſignifi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cation?</hi>
            </p>
            <p>
               <hi>Anſw.</hi> Yes, certainly they had, but yet ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny of the Jewes remained blind and ignorant thereof, and contented themſelves with the performance of the outward worke, and never
<pb n="31" facs="tcp:116585:20"/> ſaw the ſpirituall intent and miſtery of them, by which meanes they might have become pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fitable unto them.</p>
            <p>Queſt. <hi>Why doe we commonly diſtinguiſh the times, before the comming of Christ, and the time ſince his comming, by theſe termes (of under the Law, and under the Goſpell) was not the Goſpell preached before the comming of Chriſt in the fleſh?</hi>
            </p>
            <p>
               <hi>Anſw.</hi> Yes, it was preached to <hi>Adam,</hi> and to the Patriarkes, and alſo by the Prophets, (as we ſaid before) but yet to very few, but the Nation of the Jewes and but darkly unto them, under Tipes and ſhadowes; But ſince his com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ming, it hath not onely been publiſhed to them, but almoſt to all Nations in the world, and therefore in regard of the abundant Revelation of the Goſpell, the accompliſhing of the worke of mans Redemption, and the powerfull worke of God, cauſing ſo many to entertaine and em<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>brace it, therefore doe we call this the time of the Goſpell, or the joyfull time, wherein the glad tydings of ſalvation is brought not only to Jewes, but to Gentiles alſo.</p>
            <p>Queſt. <hi>When began this Goſpell to be ſo plen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tifully preached?</hi>
            </p>
            <p>
               <hi>Anſw.</hi> It began firſt to be preached by <hi>Iohn</hi> Baptiſt, and afterwards by Chriſt, and by the
<pb n="32" facs="tcp:116585:21"/> Diſciples ſent out by him but more abundant<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly by the Apoſtles, after the Death, Reſur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rection, and Aſcention of Chriſt, <hi>Math.</hi> 28.20.</p>
            <p>Queſt. <hi>We have formerly ſpoken of the death of Chriſt, now tell me what became of him after the Iewes had put him to that ſhamefull death?</hi>
            </p>
            <p>
               <hi>Anſw.</hi> He was Buried <hi>Io.</hi> 19.40, 41 42.</p>
            <p>Queſt. <hi>By whom was he buried?</hi>
            </p>
            <p>
               <hi>Anſw.</hi> By <hi>Ioſeph</hi> of <hi>Arimathea,</hi> who went to <hi>Pilate,</hi> and begged the body of Jeſus, and layd it in a new Sepulchre, which he had hewen out for himſelfe <hi>Iohn</hi> 19.38.</p>
            <p>Queſt. <hi>Did he continue long in the Grave?</hi>
            </p>
            <p>
               <hi>Anſw.</hi> He roſe againe the third day, <hi>Math.</hi> 28.6. 1 <hi>Cor.</hi> 15.4. <hi>Math.</hi> 16.21.</p>
            <p>Queſt. <hi>Wherefore did Chriſt riſe againe?</hi>
            </p>
            <p>
               <hi>Anſw.</hi> To ſhew unto us that hee had over<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>come all the powers of the Divell, Hell, and Death, and the Grave, for our Juſtification, <hi>Rom.</hi> 5.25.</p>
            <p>Queſt. <hi>To whom did hee ſhew himſelfe after his Reſurrection?</hi>
            </p>
            <p>
               <hi>Anſw.</hi> To <hi>Mary Magdalen,</hi> and the other <hi>Mary, Mark.</hi> 16.9. and to two Diſciples as they went to <hi>Emmaus, Mark.</hi> 16.12. <hi>Luke</hi> 24.13. And to the eleven Apoſtles, as they ſate toge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther, <hi>Iohn</hi> 20.19. and to more then five hundred
<pb n="33" facs="tcp:116585:21"/> Brethren at once, and alſo at ſundry other times, when they were together, hee ſhewed himſelfe unto them alive after his paſſion, by many infallible proofes and teſtimonies, <hi>Acts</hi> 1.</p>
            <p>Queſt. <hi>How long did he remaine with them after his reſurrection?</hi>
            </p>
            <p>
               <hi>Anſwer.</hi> He was ſeen of them after his re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſurrection by the ſpace of forty dayes, <hi>Acts</hi> 1.3.</p>
            <p>Queſt. <hi>VVhat did hee with them all that time?</hi>
            </p>
            <p>
               <hi>Anſ.</hi> He ſpake unto them of the things per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>taining to the kingdome of God, <hi>Acts</hi> 1.3.</p>
            <p>Queſt. <hi>What ſpeciall promiſe did he make un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to them before his departure?</hi>
            </p>
            <p>
               <hi>Anſw.</hi> That they ſhould be baptiſed with the holy Ghoſt, <hi>Acts</hi> 1.5.</p>
            <p>Queſt. <hi>What became of him after that he had ſpoken unto them of thoſe things?</hi>
            </p>
            <p>
               <hi>Anſw.</hi> He was taken up into heaven out of their ſight, a cloud receiving him, <hi>Acts</hi> 1.9.</p>
            <p>Queſt. <hi>What appeared unto them as they looked after him?</hi>
            </p>
            <p>
               <hi>Anſw.</hi> Two men appeared in white apparell, telling them that the ſame Jeſus, which was taken up from them ſhould ſo come in like manner, as they had ſeen him goe into heaven, <hi>Acts</hi> 1.10, 11.</p>
            <pb n="34" facs="tcp:116585:22"/>
            <p>Queſt. <hi>What became of the Diſciples after his the Aſcention into heaven?</hi>
            </p>
            <p>
               <hi>Anſ.</hi> They returned to <hi>Jeruſalem,</hi> from the mount called <hi>Olivet, Acts</hi> 1.12.</p>
            <p>Queſt. <hi>What did they when they came to</hi> Jeru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſalem?</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Anſw.</hi> They continued together with one accord in ſupplication and prayer, and did chooſe another Apoſtle <hi>Acts</hi> 1.14.</p>
            <p>Queſt. <hi>How did they chuſe him?</hi>
            </p>
            <p>
               <hi>Anſw.</hi> They appointed two, <hi>Joſeph</hi> called <hi>Barſabas,</hi> who was ſurnamed <hi>Iuſtus</hi> and <hi>Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thias</hi> and when they had prayed, they caſt lots, and the ſort fell upon <hi>Mathias,</hi> and hee was numbred with the eleven Apoſtles, <hi>Acts</hi> 1.23, 24 25, 26.</p>
            <p>Queſt. <hi>When did Chriſt performe that pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miſe, which he made unto them namely that they ſhould be baptiſed with the holy Ghoſt?</hi>
            </p>
            <p>
               <hi>Anſw.</hi> At the feaſt of Pentecoſt, which was within few dayes after his Aſcention <hi>Acts</hi> 2.</p>
            <p>Queſt. <hi>In what manner was it performed?</hi>
            </p>
            <p>
               <hi>Anſw.</hi> They being all met together in one place there came a found from heaven and fil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>led all the houſe and there appeared unto them cloven tongues like as of fire, and it ſate up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on each of them, and they were all filled with the holy Ghoſt, and began to ſpeake with other

            <p>Qu. <hi>What happened thereupon?</hi>
            </p>
            <p>
               <hi>Anſw.</hi> Many were amaſed and wondered at this great worke, and others mocking, ſaid they were full of new wine <hi>Acts</hi> 2.12.13.</p>
            <p>Queſt. <hi>How did the Apoſtles cleare themſelves, of that falſe accuſation?</hi>
            </p>
            <p>
               <hi>Anſw.

            <p>Queſt. <hi>What did the Apoſtles after they had thus cleared themſelves from that falſe accu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſation?</hi>
            </p>
            <p>
               <hi>Anſ. Peter</hi> preached unto them the death and Reſurrection of Jeſus Chriſt, telling them, that they had taken him, and by wicked hands, had crucified and ſlaine him, <hi>Acts</hi> 2.23.</p>
            <p>Queſt. <hi>What followed thereupon?</hi>
            </p>
            <p>
               <hi>Anſw.</hi> They were pricked in their hearts, and cryed out to <hi>Peter,</hi> and the reſt of the A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſtles, <hi>Men and brethren, what ſhall we doe?</hi> Acts 2.37.</p>
            <p>Qu. <hi>What counſell did they give them?</hi>
            </p>
            <p>
               <hi>Anſw.</hi> They exhorted them to repent, and be
<pb n="36" facs="tcp:116585:23"/> baptiſed in the name of Jeſus Chriſt, for the remiſſion of ſinnes <hi>Acts</hi> 2.38.</p>
            <p>Queſt. <hi>What followed upon this exhortation?</hi>
            </p>
            <p>
               <hi>Anſw.</hi> They that gladly received the Word, were baptiſed and the ſame day there were ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded to them about three thouſand ſoules, and they continued in the Apoſtles doctrine and fellowſhip and in breaking of Bread and pray<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ers <hi>Acts</hi> 2.41 42.</p>
            <p>Queſt. <hi>What followed upon this great worke, wrought upon thoſe men?</hi>
            </p>
            <p>
               <hi>Anſw.</hi> Feare came upon every ſoule and they that beleeved ſold their poſſeſſions and parted their goods to all men as every man had need, and they had all things common <hi>Acts</hi> 2.44 45.</p>
            <p>Queſt. <hi>Were any great workes done by the A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſtles?</hi>
            </p>
            <p>
               <hi>Anſw.</hi> Yea many wonders ſignes, and mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>racles were done by them. <hi>Acts</hi> 5.12.</p>
            <p>Queſt. <hi>What was the principall end of thoſe mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>racles?</hi>
            </p>
            <p>
               <hi>Anſ.</hi> God did thereby beare witneſſe to their doctrine that it was his, which they did preach, by giving them power to worke ſuch miracles, <hi>Heb.</hi> 2.4.</p>
            <p>Queſt. <hi>Were the people moved by thoſe mira<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cles to receive their doctrine?</hi>
            </p>
            <p>
               <hi>Anſw.</hi> Yea, very many were moved there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>with,
<pb n="37" facs="tcp:116585:23"/> and wondring at the miracles, believed their doctrine, and were baptiſed even as ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny as were ordained to eternall life.</p>
            <p>Queſt. <hi>Were none moved by their preaching, to believe their doctrine, but ſuch as were ordai<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned to eternall life.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>
               <hi>Anſw.</hi> Yes certainly ſuch was the power of their miniſtery, that many others believed the truth of their doctrine, and were baptiſed, as <hi>Simon Magus,</hi> and doubtleſſe divers others, which never received the ſpeciall benefit of the Goſpell which they preached, <hi>Acts</hi> 8.13. <hi>Math.</hi> 13.</p>
            <p>Qu. <hi>May ſuch outward Chriſtians be ſuffe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red to partake with the faithfull in the holy things of God?</hi>
            </p>
            <p>
               <hi>Anſw.</hi> Yes they may be ſuffered to partake with them in the outward ordinances, the Word and Sacraments untill ſuch time as they appeare to be hipocrites, and become offenſive to the Church and people of God, and then they are to be caſt out of the Church by ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>communication.</p>
            <p>Qu. <hi>Doe thoſe outward Chriſtians reſt con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tent with that common worke of grace in them?</hi>
            </p>
            <p>
               <hi>Anſ.</hi> Yes many of them do ſo long as they live and alſo conceive themſelves to bee in a good eſtate, to be the children of the Free-woman,
<pb n="38" facs="tcp:116585:24"/> whereas indeed they are children of the Bond-woman; others fall away, to an open and malicious oppoſition of the truth of God formerly profeſſed by them, <hi>Mat.</hi> 25. <hi>Io.</hi> 8.33.39.40. <hi>Math.</hi> 26.14, 15, 16.</p>
            <p>Queſt. <hi>Doe not many of them goe on very far in the profeſſion of the truth?</hi>

               <hi>Anſw.</hi> Yes doubtleſſe, many are greatly in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lightned by it, and receive it with joy, and goe on joying, and rejoycing in it for a time, and doe taſt of the heavenly gift, and of the powers of the world to come, and are made partakers of the holy Ghoſt, and ſanctified by the blood of the Covenant, <hi>Math.</hi> 13.20, 21. <hi>Heb.</hi> 6.4, 5, 6 <hi>Heb.</hi> 10.29.</p>
            <p>Queſt. <hi>Is it poſſible for ſuch to fall away and periſh?</hi>
            </p>
            <p>
               <hi>Anſw.</hi> Yes, it is poſſible for ſuch to fall a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>way, and to tread under foot, the Son of God, and to account the blood of the Covenant, wherewith he was ſanctified an unholy thing, and to deſpite the Spirit of Grace, <hi>Heb.</hi> 10.29.</p>
            <p>Queſt. <hi>May they be truly ſaid to be ſanctified that fall away and periſh?</hi>

            <p>
               <hi>Anſw.</hi> Yes, they may be truly ſaid ſo to be, and are ſo indeed, as the Apoſtle ſheweth, <hi>Heb.</hi> 10.29.</p>
            <p>Queſt. <hi>Doth not the Apoſtle there ſpeake

            </p>
            <p>
               <hi>Anſw.</hi> No certainly for there the Apoſtle declares unto us what great effects of the Spi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rit men may be partakers of and yet fall away, and periſh for ever.</p>
            <p>Queſt. <hi>What is that Sanctification which men may have and yet periſh?</hi>
            </p>
            <p>
               <hi>Anſw.</hi> It is an outward waſhing or cleanſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing cauſed by the holy Ghoſt inlightening the underſtanding, cauſing them to ſee the benefit offered in the Goſpell, by which meanes they come to a liking of it, and doe for a time re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceive it with joy, and are in many things con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>formed to the obedience of the ſame, forſaking many of their evill wayes, wherein aforetime they had tooke delight, <hi>Heb.</hi> 6.4, 5. <hi>Math,</hi> 13.20, 21. 2 <hi>Pet.</hi> 2.20.21.</p>
            <p>Queſt. <hi>Are theſe effects of the Spirit vouch<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſafed unto them, to the end they might be ſaved?</hi>
            </p>
            <p>
               <hi>Anſw.</hi> No certainly, but God doth it to gaine glory unto his name, and to leave them without excuſe, who doe quench that light in them, and willingly reſiſt and contemne that grace that is offered in the Goſpell, 2 <hi>Peter</hi> 2.21.</p>

               <hi>Anſw.</hi> The ſinne againſt the holy Ghoſt, <hi>Math.</hi> 12.31, 32.</p>
            <p>Q. <hi>Why is it called the ſin againſt the holy Ghoſt?</hi>
            </p>
            <p>
               <hi>Anſw.</hi> Becauſe it is committed directly a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainſt that light evidenced unto their conſcien<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces by the holy Ghoſt <hi>Mat.</hi> 12.31, 32. <hi>Heb.</hi> 10.26.</p>

            </p>
            <p>
               <hi>Anſw.</hi> It is a wilfull oppoſition, and rejecti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on of the Goſpell of God, after the holy Ghoſt hath inlightned them and perſwaded their hearts of the truth and benefit of the ſame, <hi>Heb.</hi> 6.4. <hi>Heb.</hi> 10.26.29.</p>
            <p>Queſt. <hi>Is it poſſible to come to know any of them that commit this ſinne?</hi>
            </p>
            <p>
               <hi>Anſw.</hi> Yes, it is poſſible, elſe would not the Apoſtle have told us, that there is a ſinne, which we ſhould not pray for 1 <hi>Iohn</hi> 5.16.</p>
            <p>Queſt. <hi>How doe you know that the Apoſtle meanes this ſinne in that place, which hee would not have us pray for?</hi>
            </p>
            <p>
               <hi>Anſw.</hi> Becauſe all other ſinnes are pardona<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble, and therefore may be prayed for, but this ſinne is unpardonable, and therefore not to be prayed for, <hi>Mathew</hi> 12.32.</p>

            </p>
            <p>
               <hi>Anſw.</hi> Becauſe the very way and meanes of
<pb n="41" facs="tcp:116585:25"/> ſalvation is deſpiſed and rejected, after they have received the knowledge of the truth, and therefore it is impoſſible to renew them againe by Repentance, ſeeing they crucifie to them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves the Sonne of God afreſh, and put him to an open ſhame <hi>Heb.</hi> 6.6.</p>
            <p>Queſt. <hi>How doe they crucifie to themſelves the Sonne of God?</hi>
            </p>
            <p>
               <hi>Anſw.</hi> Even like as the Jewes did reject Chriſt, and crucifie him when hee was with them upon earth, ſo theſe men doe now reject him, and doe crucifie him, by their wilfull con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tempt of him, and his ſacrifice; And as the Jewes did, ſo doe they, put him to an open ſhame, and ſo rejecting that ſacrifice, which was ordained of God from all eternity to take away ſinnes, it is impoſſible their ſinnes ſhould be pardoned, for there remaineth no more ſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>crifice for ſinne, <hi>Heb.</hi> 10.29.</p>
            <p>Queſt. <hi>Doe men come on a ſudden to commit this fearfull ſinne.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>
               <hi>Anſw.</hi> No, but by degrees for firſt there is a light eſteeme of the Goſpell and of the grace offered therein.</p>
            <p>Secondly, a looking back to their pleaſures paſt with ſome liking of them.</p>
            <p>Thirdly, a yeelding conſent of the will and affections to the fleſh, for the embracing of
<pb n="42" facs="tcp:116585:26"/> them againe, and ſo by little and little, returne like the dog to his owne vomit againe, and like the Sow that was waſhed to her wallowing in the mire, 2 <hi>Pet.</hi> 2.22.</p>
            <p>Queſt. <hi>Doe all the Reprobate commit this ſinne?</hi>
            </p>
            <p>
               <hi>Anſw.</hi> No, becauſe many of them, are never ſo farre inlightned by the holy Ghoſt, to ſee and perceive thoſe things, which thoſe doe that fall into that ſinne.</p>
            <p>Queſt. <hi>Is not their eſtate more miſerable that commit this ſinne then others that doe not com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mit that ſinne, and yet notwithstanding ſhall periſh for ever?</hi>
            </p>
            <p>
               <hi>Anſw.</hi> Yes certainly, for although the eſtate of others be miſerable, yet the miſery of theſe ſhall farre exceed, for to whom much hath bin committed, of him much ſhall be required, and he that knoweth his maſters will and doth it not, ſhall be beaten with many ſtripes, 2 <hi>Pet.</hi> 2.21.</p>
            <p>Queſt. <hi>Doe not ſuch as commit this ſinne, prove dangerous enemies to the Church of God?</hi>
            </p>
            <p>
               <hi>Anſw.</hi> Yes aſſuredly, none greater enemies to the truth, and to the people of God, then thoſe that once have profeſſed the truth, and afterwards have turned from the holy Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mandement delivered unto them, and there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore
<pb n="43" facs="tcp:116585:26"/> they are carefully to be taken heed of, and to be avoided, 2 <hi>Pet.</hi> 2.21.</p>
            <p>Queſt. <hi>What differing effects doth the holy Ghoſt worke in thoſe that ſhall be ſaved from thoſe that commit this horrible ſinne?</hi>
            </p>
            <p>
               <hi>Anſw.</hi> The holy Ghoſt doth worke in them that ſhall bee ſaved, a farre more excellent worke, namely, that great worke of regenera<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, conſiſting of theſe two principall effects of the Spirit, Repentance and Faith <hi>Io.</hi> 3.5.</p>
            <p>Queſt. <hi>Are none partakers of theſe two effects of the Holy Ghoſt but ſuch as ſhall be ſaved?</hi>
            </p>
            <p>
               <hi>Anſw.</hi> Not any one and none that are parta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>kers of thoſe effects of the Spirit, can poſſibly commit that ſinne, but all others, that are one<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly inlightned by the holy Ghoſt, to ſee, and know the way of ſalvation, are in danger of fal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ling into that ſinne.</p>
            <p>Queſt. <hi>What is the beſt way for ſuch to take, to be free from committing that ſinne?</hi>
            </p>
            <p>
               <hi>Anſw.</hi> The beſt way is, not to content them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves with that common grace of inlightning onely, but to labour to find in themſelves thoſe two effects of the Spirit, Repentance and Faith, and to be earneſt with the Lord by pray<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>er, that he by his Spirit, would worke effectual<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly, for the breaking their hearts, and humbling them, that ſo he may raiſe them up againe ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cording
<pb n="44" facs="tcp:116585:27"/> to his promiſe, and never to give reſt unto their ſoules, untill the Lord by his Spirit aſſure their hearts of peace and reconciliation with him.</p>
            <p>Queſt. <hi>But is not the prayer of all ſuch as are unjuſtified abominable, how can wee therefore hope that God will heare us, or grant our re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>queſts?</hi>
            </p>
            <p>
               <hi>Anſw.</hi> The prayers of all thoſe that are un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>juſtified, are not abominable, but only the prayers of ſuch wicked as hate to be reformed, and caſt the word of God behind them, but the prayers of ſuch as deſire to bee humbled for their ſinnes and to have their hearts broken, and brought in ſubjection to the will of God, and earneſtly deſire to be reconciled, and to be at peace with God are not abominable, but are pleaſing unto God and are many times heard, and granted by him.</p>
            <p>Queſt. <hi>But God heareth and granteth the re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>queſts of none but for Chriſts ſake, and all unjuſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fied men are out of Chriſt therefore how can it be that God ſhould heare them or that their prayer ſhould be pleaſing unto him.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>
               <hi>Anſw.</hi> True it is, that all unjuſtified perſons are out of Chriſt (that is) are not ingrafted in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to him by faith; And alſo God heareth and granteth no requeſts, but for Chriſts ſake;
<pb n="45" facs="tcp:116585:27"/> But yet notwithſtanding, God doth heare the requeſts of ſuch as are not actually in Chriſt, for Chriſts ſake, for God is mercifull to all his Creatures onely in Chriſt, and many thouſands enjoy mercies from the Lord for Chriſts ſake, that ſhall never enjoy ſalvation by him: And therefore though men be not actually juſtified, yet they may pray for Chriſts ſake, for the things they ſtand in need of, and bee heard of the Lord, and their prayers pleaſing, and not ſinne elſe would not the Apoſtle have adviſed <hi>Simon Magus</hi> being in the gall of bitterneſſe, to pray that if it were poſſible the thought of his heart might be forgiven him, <hi>Gen.</hi> 16.13. <hi>Chap.</hi> 21.16. <hi>Acts</hi> 8.22.</p>
            <p>Queſt. <hi>May any one of thoſe that are made partakers of that new birth and ingrafted into Chriſt, fall away and periſh?</hi>
            </p>
            <p>
               <hi>Anſw.</hi> No, it is not poſſible, for God is un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>changeable in his love, where hee once loves, with that ſpeciall love hee ever loves, for the gifts and calling of God are without Repen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tance, <hi>Rom.</hi> 11.20. <hi>Io.</hi> 12.1. <hi>Rom.</hi> 5.10.</p>
            <p>Queſt. <hi>But they fall into many ſinnes after regeneration, and therefore may not God juſtly caſt them off?</hi>
            </p>
            <p>
               <hi>Anſw.</hi> True it is they fall into ſinnes after regeneration, and if wee looke upon Gods
<pb n="46" facs="tcp:116585:28"/> Juſtice only we cannot ſay, but hee might caſt them oft; But yet God wil be true in his pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miſe, and as he did manifeſt his mercy, and love unto them in their new birth ſo will be mani<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>feſt his mercy in preſerving them, ſo that al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>though they doe ſinne daily, yet ſhall it not condemne them; For God doth juſtifie them through Chriſts death, and if God juſtifie, who may condemne <hi>Rom.</hi> 8.33.34.</p>
            <p>Queſt. <hi>Then it ſeemes that the ſtedfaſtneſſe of man in Grace, conſiſts not in his owne power and ſtrength but in the unchangeable, Decree, and mercy of God?</hi>
            </p>
            <p>
               <hi>Anſw.</hi> No, aſſuredly it conſiſts not in his owne power and ſtrength, but in the unchange<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ableneſſe of Gods love for they are kept by the power of God through faith unto ſalvation, wherein conſiſteth ſome part of mans happi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſſe for now by Grace he is ſet into a better eſtate and condition then <hi>Adam</hi> was by his Creation, who was ſubject to change, 1 <hi>Pe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter</hi> 1.5.</p>
            <p>Queſt. <hi>Doth not the knowledge of this Do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctrine concerning mans ſtedfaſtneſſe in grace make men ſecure and careleſſe in the committing of ſinne?</hi>
            </p>
            <p>
               <hi>Anſw.</hi> No certainly, it is not poſſible, that any of thoſe that are regenerate ſhould make
<pb n="47" facs="tcp:116585:28"/> ſuch an uſe of it, but rather they conſidering Gods rich mercy and abundant grace, ſhowed towards them, doe labour to deny ungodlineſſe, and worldly luſts, and doe endeavour to live ſoberly, righteouſly, and godly, ſeeing the grace of God that bringeth ſalvation unto all men, hath ſo plentifully appeared unto them, <hi>Titus</hi> 2.11.12. <hi>Rom.</hi> 12.1.</p>
            <p>Queſt. <hi>Doe not many of the regenerate fall into great ſinnes after their regeneration!</hi>
            </p>
            <p>
               <hi>Anſw.</hi> Yes certainly, wee have examples thereof, in <hi>Noah, David</hi> and <hi>Peter,</hi> who did fall into great ſinnes after they were regene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rate, <hi>Gen.</hi> 9.21. 2 <hi>Sam.</hi> 11.4.13 14, 15. <hi>Chap.</hi> 12.9. <hi>Mat.</hi> 26.70.72.74.</p>
            <p>Queſt. <hi>What great dammage doth come unto them by their Falls ſeeing they cannot fall away and periſh for ever?</hi>
            </p>
            <p>
               <hi>Anſw.</hi> The dammage is very great, for be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſides the diſhonour of God (whoſe glory ought to be deare unto them) they deprive themſelves of their ſweet peace, joy and com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fort, which they did enjoy, and doe caſt them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves into great trouble of mind, ſorrow, and feare, and many times cauſe the Lord, to puniſh them for their ſinne with ſome tem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>porall puniſhment, 2 <hi>Sam.</hi> 12. <hi>Pſal.</hi> 51.</p>
            <pb n="48" facs="tcp:116585:29"/>
            <p>Queſt. <hi>What is required of men falling into Sinne after Iuſtification?</hi>
            </p>
            <p>
               <hi>Anſw.</hi> That they ſhould repent of their Sins and ſeeke earneſtly at the hand of God, for the pardon of them as <hi>David</hi> did <hi>Pſal.</hi> 51.</p>
            <p>Queſt. <hi>Is it in mans power to repent?</hi>
            </p>
            <p>
               <hi>Anſw.</hi> No it is not, it is the gift of God, 2 <hi>Tim.</hi> 2.15</p>
            <p>Queſt. <hi>Wherefore then doth the Lord require of man to repent and beleeve ſeeing he is unable to performe the ſame?</hi>
            </p>
            <p>
               <hi>Anſw.</hi> The Lord requires of us to repent and beleeve becau<gap reason="illegible" resp="#OXF" extent="1 letter">

               </gap>e they are workes to be perfor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>med by us, and that we ſeeing our ſelves un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>able to performe them might be mooved to ſeeke for them at the hands of God, who is the only giver of them.</p>
            <p>Queſt. <hi>What need is there for them to repent who have formerly received pardon of their Sinne and cannot poſſibly periſh becauſe Chriſts death was a full ſatisfaction not only for their Sinnes paſt, but for all that ever they ſhould commit du<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ring this life?</hi>
            </p>
            <p>
               <hi>Anſw.</hi> Yes certainly Repentance is very needfull for them, and therefore the Apoſtle councelleth them, (amongſt the reſt of their ſpirituall armour <hi>Epheſians</hi> 6. to have their feet ſhod with the preparation of the Goſpell of
<pb n="51" facs="tcp:116585:29"/> peace, which is Repentance) for by their ſinne they having diſhonoured God and greeved his Spirit, and having alſo deprived themſelves of their ſweet Communion they had with God there is no other way to obtaine their peace, joy, comfort and ſweet Communion with God againe but by Repentance, as we may ſee by the example of <hi>David Pſal.</hi> 51.</p>
            <p>Queſt. <hi>Then Repentance doth not ceaſe in men aſſoone as they are juſtifyed and reconciled unto God?</hi>
            </p>
            <p>
               <hi>Anſw.</hi> No aſſuredly, for although they have attained the thing their ſoules ſo much deſired in the day of their trouble and their wounded ſoules be healed and refreſhed, yet doe they ſtill retaine their ſoft and melting heart which doth daily mourne and lament for the body of Sin, and remnant of Corruption that is left in them whereby they are led Captive to Sinne and to offend their Lord and Redeemer who hath been ſo rich and abundant in mercy towards them, <hi>Rom.</hi> 7.23.24.</p>
            <p>Queſt. <hi>Then it ſeemes that the eſtate of a true Chriſtian in this life is a very ſorrowfull and mournfull eſtate?</hi>
            </p>
            <p>
               <hi>Anſw.</hi> It is true indeed their life is full of ſor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>row, this is their time of mourning and wee<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ping, they of all others are ſubject to many per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſecutions
<pb n="50" facs="tcp:116585:30"/> diſgraces and reproaches, beſides the corruption that is within them which pur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſues their ſoules daily, ſo that if their hope were only in this life, they were of all men the moſt miſerable.</p>
            <p>But yet notwithſtanding in the midſt of their afflictions and perſecutions, the Lord doth give them inward joy and comfort by his Spi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rit, farre exceeding all worldly Joy that this world can afford, and none but they have any ſound Joy; but they only doe poſſeſſe that Joy, which is unſpeakable and full of glory, and which ſhall never be taken from them, <hi>Io.</hi> 16.22.</p>
            <p>Queſt. <hi>From whence proceedeth that unſpeake<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>able Ioy which the faithfull doe enjoy?</hi>
            </p>
            <p>
               <hi>Anſw.</hi> It proceedeth from the apprehenſion of Gods love unto them, who hath remitted their Sinnes, and aſſured them of peace and re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>conciliation with him, 1 <hi>Io.</hi> 4.10.19.</p>

            <p>Queſt. <hi>Was not Chriſt the principall cauſe of man ſalvation?</hi>
            </p>
            <p>
               <hi>Anſw.</hi> No aſſuredly, he was indeed the ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teriall cauſe, but not the efficient or principall mooving cauſe, for howſoever it be true that every perſon in the Godhead, did our of their infinite love decree from all eternity the ſal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vation of man, yet in the effecting, and accom<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pliſhing of the ſame, every perſon hath his di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtinct operation and worke appropriated unto him, ſo that we cannot without confuſion at<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tribute that to one perſon which is proper and peculiar to another.</p>
            <p>Queſt. <hi>Declare unto me briefly the ſeverall worke of every perſon in the Godhead diſtinctly and ſeverally in the working of the Redemption of man?</hi>
            </p>
            <p>
               <hi>Anſw.</hi> The worke appropriated in Scrip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tures to the firſt perſon, namely the Father is of his meere love to have ſent his onely Sonne; and the worke of the Son is to be ſent and to take mans nature upon him, to ſuffer death, to ſatisfie the Juſtice of God, and to effect and bring to paſſe that great worke of mans Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>demption,
<pb n="54" facs="tcp:116585:31"/> and the worke of the third perſon the Holy Ghoſt is to inlighten the underſtanding of the elect in this great miſtery, and to make effectuall unto them this Redemption, which Chriſt hath wrought for them.</p>
            <p>Queſt. <hi>Might not the Lord have ſaved man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>kind out of his owne love and goodneſſe without the ſending of his Son to take upon him our nature and to ſuffer death?</hi>
            </p>
            <p>
               <hi>Anſw.</hi> Whether he might or no, we will not dare to conclude, but that which may be pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fitable for us we will affirme, that certaine it is, that this way, which the Lord hath ordayned, and alſo made knowne unto us, did beſt ſtand with his Iuſtice, and doth ſerve the more to manifeſt his Attributes of wiſdome, power, goodneſſe, love, and mercy, then if he had ſaved man without the giving his Sonne to death for him.</p>
            <p>Queſt. <hi>Who are they that have the ſpeciall be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nefit by the death of Chriſt?</hi>
            </p>
            <p>
               <hi>Anſw.</hi> All have benefit thereby, but the elect only have the ſpeciall benefit of Redemption and Juſtification by him, And all the reſt of the Sonnes of <hi>Adam</hi> have a common benefit en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>joying for Chriſts ſake the continuance of the world and the abundant bleſſings thereof.</p>
            <p>Queſt. <hi>What difference is there betweene Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>demption and Juſtification?</hi>
            </p>
            <pb n="55" facs="tcp:116585:31"/>
            <p>
               <hi>Anſw.</hi> There is this difference, Redempti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on is a worke, which Chriſt hath wrought for all the Elect, even for them alſo which are yet unborne: and Juſtification is the free declara<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of Gods eternall love free grace and mer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cy, which he worketh in his good time in the hearts of his Elect, making knowne unto them, that the Redemption which Chriſt hath wrought is for them, and that they have part and portion therein.</p>
            <p>Queſt. <hi>Wherein conſiſteth mans Iuſtifica<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion?</hi>
            </p>
            <p>
               <hi>Anſw.</hi> It conſiſteth in the free remiſſion and taking away of the guilt and puniſhment of Sin, and in the imputation of Chriſts righteouſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſſe, <hi>Acts</hi> 10.43. <hi>Pſal.</hi> 32.1. <hi>Rom.</hi> 4.6,</p>
            <p>Queſt. <hi>By what meanes doe they come to bee thus freed from the guilt and puniſhment of ſin. and alſo to have the righteouſneſſe of Chriſt im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>puted unto them?</hi>
            </p>
            <p>
               <hi>Anſw.</hi> By the meere grace and favour of God, for as there was nothing but his owne love to move him to elects them, ſo there was nothing but his owne love to move him to ju<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtifie them <hi>Epheſ.</hi> 2.8.</p>
            <p>Queſt. <hi>How is this made knowne unto them?</hi>
            </p>
            <p>
               <hi>Anſw.</hi> It is revealed unto them by the holy Ghoſt, who aſſureth them of peace and recon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciliation
<pb n="54" facs="tcp:116585:32"/> with God through Jeſus Chriſt, and alſo worketh in them faith to lay hold and to apply unto themſelves the ſpeciall and peculiar promiſes of the Goſpell. <hi>Rom.</hi> 5.1. <hi>Epheſ.</hi> 8.</p>
            <p>Queſt. <hi>Are not all men ſet free, from the guilt and puniſhment of ſinne by the death of Chriſt?</hi>
            </p>
            <p>
               <hi>Anſw.</hi> No certainly; none but thoſe whom God did make choyce of from all eternity to be veſſels of mercy.</p>
            <p>Queſt. <hi>Wherfore ſhould God make choice of ſome and leave others, ſeeing all had ſinned alike in</hi> Adam <hi>and all alike corrupted?</hi>
            </p>
            <p>
               <hi>Anſw.</hi> There was nothing in man at all, in one more then in another, but it was his good pleaſure, nothing moving him thereunto but his owne will. <hi>Rom.</hi> 9.</p>
            <p>Queſt. <hi>Did the Lord then make ſome men of purpoſe to deſtroy them, and to condemne them for ever?</hi>
            </p>
            <p>
               <hi>Anſw.</hi> The Lord did decree from all eter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nity, to ſave ſome, and to leave others, but yet notwithſtanding, hee did not create them of purpoſe to deſtroy them; For the end of mans Creation, was the glory of God, and in their Creation he did not intend the deſtruction of the creature, but his owne glory; and he made man righteous, but he brought deſtruction up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on
<pb n="55" facs="tcp:116585:32"/> himſelfe by rebelling againſt God, <hi>Hoſea</hi> 13.9. <hi>Eccle.</hi> 7.29.</p>
            <p>Queſt. <hi>Then the Lord is not the Author of mans condemnation?</hi>
            </p>
            <p>
               <hi>Anſw.</hi> He is not the Author thereof, but man himſelfe, for God at firſt did make man righteous and holy, and gave him power to o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bey and ſerve him, but hee willingly of him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelfe fell to diſobey the command of God, and ſo made himſelfe liable to eternall wrath and condemnation. <hi>Hoſea</hi> 13.9. <hi>Eccle.</hi> 7.29.</p>
            <p>Queſt. <hi>Why did not God make man ſo abſolute perfect in himſelfe, that he could not poſſibly have fallen, but might have ſtood in his perfection of himſelfe?</hi>
            </p>
            <p>
               <hi>Anſw.</hi> It could not poſſibly be, unleſſe hee ſhould have been God, for it is proper only un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to God to be ſo abſolute perfect and immuta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble, and cannot bee in any creature whatſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ever.</p>
            <p>Queſt. <hi>Doe not the good Angels ſtand in their ſtate of perfection and glory by themſelves?</hi>
            </p>
            <p>
               <hi>Anſw.</hi> No verily, it is through the free grace and goodneſſe of God, that they ſtand and not of their owne power, and that they and we alſo might ſee our owne weakneſſe, and that we all ſtand through his grace, he ſuffered both An<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gels and man to fall.</p>
            <pb n="58" facs="tcp:116585:33"/>
            <p>Queſt. <hi>Why did not God as well puniſh all the Angells as ſome of them, ſeeing hee puniſhed all mankind for</hi> Adam's <hi>ſin?</hi>
            </p>
            <p>
               <hi>Anſw.</hi> The caſe is not alike, for we all ſin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned in <hi>Adam,</hi> being in his loynes, and are therefore polluted with corruption of nature, and doe bring forth the evill fruit of ſinne and rebellion againſt God. But it was not ſo with Angels, they did not proceed from one another by naturall generation, and therefore not in the ſame manner corrupted, but were all crea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted glorious creatures; And it was but ſome of the Angels that ſinned, and therefore none but them that ſinned were puniſhed; And al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>though he ſuffered all men to fall, yet he pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vided a remedy to reſtore part of them againe through Jeſus Chriſt, and to make them heires of glory for ever.</p>
            <p>Queſt. <hi>Is not the remedy ſufficient to redeeme all mankind that had fallen through</hi> Adams <hi>tranſgreſſion?</hi>
            </p>
            <p>
               <hi>Anſw.</hi> It is ſufficient doubtleſſe, being a price of an infinite value, and all men are thereby ſet in a poſſibility of ſalvation, and as we ſaid be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore all men enjoy good by Chriſt, yet notwith<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtanding, God did not purpoſe nor intend to give his Sonne to death, to redeeme all man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>kind, and ſo to ſave them for ever, but only for
<pb n="59" facs="tcp:116585:33"/> thoſe whom he had elected and made choice of, to be veſſells of mercy, in his wiſdome from all eternity, the Lords workes and doings are unchangeable.</p>
            <p>Queſt. <hi>But the Lord exhorts all men to repent, and to turne to him, promiſing to pardon their ſins if they do repent; How then is it that God did not purpoſe to ſave all mankind by Chriſts death?</hi>
            </p>
            <p>
               <hi>Anſw.</hi> It is true indeed, that all men are exhorted to repent, and the promiſes are made generally to all that doe repent, but none doe repent, but only the elect and choſen of God, and therefore none but they enjoy the ſpeciall promiſes of grace and mercy.</p>
            <p>Queſt. <hi>But what is the reaſon that all doe not repent, that ſo they might have right unto thoſe ſpeciall promiſes of grace and mercy through Chriſt?</hi>
            </p>
            <p>
               <hi>Anſw.</hi> The fault is in man who through the corruption of his heart, reſiſts this grace and mercy offered, and ſo hardens his heart in ſinne, chooſing rather to enjoy his pleaſure here then to humble himſelfe to walke with God to enjoy his grace and mercy for ever.</p>
            <p>Queſt. <hi>Have the Elect any more power in themſelves, then others, to repent and turne to the Lord?</hi>
            </p>
            <p>
               <hi>Anſw.</hi> No, none at all, but Repentance is
<pb n="58" facs="tcp:116585:34"/> the gift of God, (as we ſaid before) and it is he that by his Spirit doth effect this great worke in them, 2 <hi>Tim.</hi> 2.25.</p>
            <p>Queſt. <hi>Why doth not God give repentance to all, and ſo ſave all by Chriſt, that ſo all men might for ever glorifie and praiſe his mercy?</hi>
            </p>
            <p>
               <hi>Anſw.</hi> It was his purpoſe from all eternity, as well to ſet forth the glory of his Juſtice, as of his mercy, and therefore as he did not in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tend, nor purpoſe to ſave them by Chriſt, ſo neither would he beſtow upon them any ſpeci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>all benefit tending that way.</p>
            <p>Queſt. <hi>Wherefore doth God call and exhort all men to repent, ſeeing all cannot attaine there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>unto?</hi>
            </p>
            <p>
               <hi>Anſw.</hi> Hee doth it for theſe Reaſons;</p>
            <p>Firſt, becauſe his elect are mingled amongſt others, and therefore he doth ſend his Word, and call upon all men to repent.</p>
            <p>Secondly, he doth it to manifeſt to all the freeneſſe of his grace, that he is ready to re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceive all that come to him.</p>
            <p>Thirdly, to leave all men without excuſe, and that their condemnation might more ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nifeſtly appeare to be juſt, ſeeing that grace and mercy was offered them and they willingly refuſed and rejected it, and at that great day of Judgement, every mouth ſhall bee ſtopped,
<pb n="59" facs="tcp:116585:34"/> and every one appeare culpable before God.</p>
            <p>Queſt. <hi>But ſeeing that God hath elected ſonne, and rejected others, is it not therefore in vaine to heare or reade the word of God, to pray unto him, or to uſe any meanes to come to the knowledge of the way of life and ſalvation?</hi>
            </p>
            <p>
               <hi>Anſw.</hi> No verily, for ſeeing theſe things are required of all men, all are bound to take knowledge thereof, and to reject or refuſe them, is to reject and refuſe God, who offers his grace therein, and doth by them worke grace in his elect, now ſeeing ſome there are, that reape benefit by the uſe of them, and that no man can conclude of himſelfe, that God hath not elected him, it is not in vaine to uſe the meanes, but it is meere madneſſe and folly to refuſe and reject them.</p>
            <p>Queſt. <hi>But by this meanes men may come to ſuch a meaſure of knowledge, and to bee ſo farre inlightned that they may be in danger to commit the ſin againſt the holy Ghoſt, and ſo make their condemnation the greater?</hi>
            </p>
            <p>
               <hi>Anſw.</hi> This commeth not by the carefull uſe of the meanes, but by the abuſe thereof, and light eſteeme of the grace offered, and there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore they are to take heed of thoſe things that may be any occaſion thereunto.</p>
            <p>Queſt. <hi>Is it neceſſary that this doctrine con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cerning
<pb n="62" facs="tcp:116585:35"/> Gods Predeſtination ſhould bee made knowne, ſeeing that it may bee hurtfull to many, making ſome ſecure and careleſſe in uſing any meanes of ſalvation, and alſo cauſing others to deſpaire?</hi>
            </p>
            <p>
               <hi>Anſw.</hi> It is neceſſary to bee knowne, and therefore hath the Lord beene pleaſed to re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>veale it, and doubtleſſe no hurt ſhall come thereby to any of the elect, but exceeding much good, for it ſerves greatly to humble them, and to let them ſee, that it is no defert of theirs, but the free grace of God, who might have choſen others, and rejected them; And as for the reſt, they will abuſe every truth, though it be never ſo good and profitable, and therefore ſeeing God hath been pleaſed to re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>veale it, the Elect are not to be deprived of this Benefit, becauſe of the abuſe of them by the Reprobate.</p>
            <p>Queſt. <hi>Wherefore is it, that in Scripture our Juſtification is attributed unto Faith?</hi>
            </p>
            <p>
               <hi>Anſw.</hi> We are ſaid to be juſtified by Faith, not that Faith juſtifieth of it ſelfe, but becauſe it is a gift of God, whereby man believeth that which the Spirit declareth and evidenceth to the conſcience, namely, the pardon of ſinne, and aſſurance of grace through the blood of Chriſt.</p>
            <pb n="63" facs="tcp:116585:35"/>
            <p>Secondly becauſe all our owne workes are ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cluded in the matter of Juſtification before God, and there is no cauſe of boaſting, for our ſalvation is onely of the Lord, <hi>Hoſea</hi> 13.9.</p>
            <p>Queſt. <hi>If good workes doe not juſtifie before God, to what end are they ſo often required?</hi>
            </p>
            <p>
               <hi>Anſw.</hi> They are required for divers ends.</p>
            <p>Firſt becauſe by them we ſhall glorifie God and adorne our holy profeſſion, <hi>Math.</hi> 5.16.</p>
            <p>Secondly we ſhall by them be a means to win others to love our profeſſion and give good ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>amples to others to doe the like and to follow us. 1 <hi>Pet.</hi> 2.12.</p>
            <p>Thirdly by this means we ſhall ſtop the mouthes of the adverſaries 1 <hi>Pet.</hi> 2.15.</p>
            <p>Fourthly we ſhall have comfort, if we be brought to ſuffer, and be accuſed as evill doers wrongfully, 1 <hi>Pet.</hi> 2.19.</p>
            <p>Fifthly we ſhall by them make tryall of the truth of our faith and of the graces that are in us by the exerciſe of them as occaſion is offe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red.</p>
            <p>Queſt. <hi>But doe not good workes deſerve no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing at the hands of God?</hi>
            </p>
            <p>
               <hi>Anſw.</hi> No certainly, no workes that we can doe can poſſibly deſerve any thing at the hands of God; for when we have done all that we can, we may truly ſay we are unprofitable ſervants, <hi>Luke</hi> 17.10.</p>
            <pb n="62" facs="tcp:116585:36"/>
            <p>Queſt. <hi>If good workes deſerve nothing where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore is it that ſo many promiſes are made in Scrip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture unto good workes?</hi>
            </p>
            <p>
               <hi>Anſw.</hi> God hath thereby ſet forth his boun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty to ſtir us up; who are backward of our ſelves, adding thereunto promiſes of reward, But ſuch is our weakeneſſe and great imperfections in our beſt workes, that we haue cauſe rather to be humbled for our wants in the performance of them, then to challenge any thing at the hands of God for the ſame, &amp; yet certaine it is, that the good workes of Gods Children ſhall be rewarded, though not for the worthineſſe of the worke, yet for the truth of the promiſer, who hath promiſed to reward the gift of a cup of cold water to one of thoſe that belong to him, ſo that we have no cauſe to be backward in good workes, but to be forward in the doing of them. <hi>Math.</hi> 10.42.</p>
            <p>Queſt. <hi>Are all men rewarded for their good workes?</hi>
            </p>
            <p>
               <hi>Anſw.</hi> Yes certainly the righteous, God re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wardeth all, either here in this life or after this life; but he in a more eſpeciall manner rewar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deth the good workes of his Children even thoſe workes of love and mercy extended to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wards the Saints their Brethren, <hi>Math.</hi> 25.</p>
            <p>Queſt. <hi>Are there Saints now upon the earth?</hi>
            </p>
            <pb n="63" facs="tcp:116585:36"/>
            <p>
               <hi>Anſw.</hi> Yes verily, there have been, are, and ever ſhall be Saints upon the earth, <hi>Pſal.</hi> 16.3.</p>
            <p>Queſt. <hi>But ſeeing all men are corrupted and even after regeneration the remnants of Sinne ſtill continue in them can the name of Saints be properly given unto them?</hi>
            </p>
            <p>
               <hi>Anſw.</hi> Yes it may be well given unto them for God ſo accounts of them as being without Sinne, beholding no iniquity in them, <hi>Num<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bers</hi> 23.21. <hi>Canticles</hi> 4.7. <hi>Epheſ.</hi> 5.27.</p>
            <p>Queſt. <hi>If God behold all things and nothing be hid from his all-ſeeing eye, how can it be but that he ſhould ſee thoſe Sinnes which his elect doe daily and continually fall into?</hi>
            </p>
            <p>
               <hi>Anſw.</hi> It is true that God beholdeth all things and cannot be ignorant of thoſe Sinnes which they fall into, yet notwithſtanding God doth looke upon them in Chriſt and beholds them all righteous and holy in him, imputing the rigteouſneſſe of Chriſt unto them, <hi>Rom.</hi> 4.6.7. 1 <hi>Cor.</hi> 1.30. 2 <hi>Cor.</hi> 5.21.</p>
            <p>Queſt. <hi>What is that righteouſneſſe of Chriſt which is imputed unto the Saints, and for which they are accounted holy?</hi>
            </p>
            <p>
               <hi>Anſw.</hi> All the righteouſneſſe of Chriſt what<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſoever, his active obedience performed to the law, his paſſive obedience in ſuffering whatſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ever was due unto them for Sinne, and what
<pb n="66" facs="tcp:116585:37"/> the Juſtice of God could require at their hands; yea all the holineſſe that is in Chriſt, ei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther of his nature, as hee was man, or of his actions as he was Mediator betweene God and man is all imputed unto them, 1 <hi>Cor.</hi> 1.30. <hi>Rom.</hi> 5.19. <hi>Eſay</hi> 9.6.</p>
            <p>Queſt. <hi>Then by imputation they are abſolute, holy and righteous?</hi>
            </p>
            <p>
               <hi>Anſw.</hi> Yes verily, they are ſo, even abſolute, pure righteous and holy, <hi>Numb.</hi> 23.21.</p>
            <p>Queſt. <hi>Have they no other holineſſe, but this which is imputed unto them?</hi>
            </p>

               <hi>Anſw.</hi> Yes verily, for as God doth impute holineſſe unto them, even the holineſſe of Chriſt (in whom alone they are accepted as righteous) ſo alſo doth hee worke holineſſe in them, by his Spirit, making them in ſome mea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſure conformable to Chriſt, renewing and ſan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctifying, and making them holy, and cauſing them alſo to work holineſſe and righteouſneſſe, which is one maine end of their election, and of their Redemption by Jeſus Chriſt <hi>Epheſ.</hi> 1.4 <hi>Luke</hi> 1.74 75.</p>

            <p>
               <hi>Anſw.</hi> It is very true, he did not, but it was his owne love and free grace that moved him, for they are elected and choſen of God, not for any foreſeene holineſſe, but to be holy, being his workmanſhip, created in Chriſt Jeſus unto good workes, that they ſhould walke in them, <hi>Epheſ.</hi> 2.10. So that good workes are no cauſe of their Election but their Election is the cauſe of their good workes, and good workes are an evidence both to themſelves, and to others alſo of their election, but no cauſe thereof, 1 <hi>Pet,</hi> 1.2. <hi>Epheſ.</hi> 1.4.</p>

            <p>Queſt. <hi>But the members of this Church are diſperſed, and cannot meet together, how can

               <hi>Anſw.</hi> Yes doubtleſſe they may, and the Saints doe aſſuredly reape great comfort and benefit thereby, yea every Congregation, and company of Saints meeting together in the name of Chriſt, may expect and tooke for the performance of the promiſes made by Chriſt to the whole Church, for that which is made to the whole Church, is made alſo to every part thereof.</p>

            </p>
            <p>
               <hi>Anſw.</hi> Unto them thus meeting together hath Chriſt promiſed his preſence to be in the middeſt of them, and hath given unto them the keyes of the kingdome of heaven, to bind and looſe, promiſing them to confirme and ratifie in heaven, what they agree upon in earth, bind<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing in heaven whom they bind on earth, and looſing in heaven whom they looſe on earth, promiſing them alſo perſeverance (notwith<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtanding the great malice of their Adverſaries) the gates of hell ſhall never prevaile againſt it, <hi>Math.</hi> 16.18 19. <hi>Math.</hi> 18.20. <hi>Math.</hi> 18.18.19, 20.</p>

            <p>
               <hi>Anſw.</hi> No certainly, it belongs to none o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther but onely to them, neither are any fit for ſuch a worke, but onely the Saints, neither is the promiſe of binding in heaven, and looſing in heaven them who are bound on earth, and looſed on earth, made to any other, but only to the Saints, the true members of Jeſus Chriſt, and therefore whoſoever they be that lay claim or title to this power, and are not Saints, doe claime and challenge that unto which they have no right, <hi>Math.</hi> 16.18, 19. <hi>Math.</hi> 18.19.20.</p>
            <p>Queſt. <hi>But is it not given to the Paſtors and Miniſters of the Church?</hi>
            </p>
            <p>
               <hi>Anſw.</hi> Yes, it is given chiefly unto them, if they be Saints yet not only to them, but alſo (with them) to the reſt of the Saints their Brethren.</p>
            <p>Queſt. <hi>But all the Saints are not fit to be im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ployed in this great worke?</hi>
            </p>
            <p>
               <hi>Anſw.</hi> It is true that all the Saints may not be fit for this worke, and therefore thoſe are to be employed in the great affaires of the Church, who have the greateſt meaſure of Grace, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtowed on them, according to that ſaying of
<pb n="69" facs="tcp:116585:39"/> the Apoſtle, 1 <hi>Pet.</hi> 4.10. as God hath diſtributed to every man, ſo let him miniſter &amp;c. yet the leaſt Saint is not to be deſpiſed or contemned who may be helpfull to the body whereof by Chriſt they are made members. 1 <hi>Cor.</hi> 12.21.</p>
            <p>Queſt. <hi>Is it poſſible for the Saints in this life to know one another?</hi>
            </p>
            <p>
               <hi>Anſw.</hi> Yes doubtleſſe, God doth declare and evidence them by his Spirit, even to the conſciences of his children, that ſo they, may rejoyce in the fellowſhip one of another, and perform the duties required of them one to another, to the performance of which the reward is promiſed, which they cannot perform unleſſe they know one another, <hi>Math.</hi> 25. <hi>chap.</hi> 10.40, 41, 42.</p>
            <p>Queſt. <hi>But hipocrites may countterfeit true grace, and make a ſhow of holineſſe, and Satan can transforme himſelfe into an Angell of light?</hi>
            </p>
            <p>
               <hi>Anſw.</hi> All this is true, you ſay but yet the Saints having the Spirit of Chriſt in them, and knowing the nature of true grace, are able to judge of and to diſcerne true grace from the counterfeit ſhowes of hypocrites.</p>
            <p>Queſt. <hi>But hipocriſie is hid in the heart, and it is proper to God to know the heart, and the A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſtle ſaith,</hi> 1 Cor. 2.11. That no man knoweth
<pb n="70" facs="tcp:116585:40"/> the things of a man, but the ſpirit of man which is in him.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Anſw.</hi> It is true alſo, but yet notwithſtand<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing the hearts of others are manifeſt unto them, when God ſhall reveale them unto his Saints, by making ſuch a cleare evidence of his grace to appeare, ſo that they may diſcerne the ſame worke of grace in others, that is in them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves; For it is impoſſible that true grace ſhould alwayes lye hid, but it will be manife<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſted, at one time or other, to the comfort and rejoycing of the reſt of the Saints.</p>
            <p>Queſt. <hi>But by the parable of the Draw-net, in the thirteenth of</hi> Mathew <hi>it doth appeare that there may be wicked men in the Church undiſco<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vered, and not knowne to be hypocrites, untill the great day of the Lord?</hi>
            </p>
            <p>
               <hi>Anſw.</hi> It is true, there may bee ſuch, for I doe not ſay, that all hypocrites may be diſcer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned and knowne, but that it is poſſible for the Saints to know one another even in this life.</p>
            <p>Queſt. <hi>If all the Saints may be diſcerned and knowne, then thoſe that are not diſcerned to bee Saints are to be judged hipocrites?</hi>
            </p>
            <p>
               <hi>Anſw.</hi> We cannot ſo conclude of them, for though they bee nor, as yet diſcerned and knowne, yet afterwards they may be, or they may be Saints, and depart this life undiſcerned,
<pb n="71" facs="tcp:116585:40"/> through want of the fellowſhip of the Saints who onely are able to diſcern the truth of grace in the Saints.</p>
            <p>Queſt. <hi>But how may we diſcern and know o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thers to be Saints?</hi>
            </p>
            <p>
               <hi>Anſw.</hi> It is very hard to ſet down any par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ticular notes whereby they may be knowne, becauſe the graces that do demonſtrate them to be Saints, are inward, and therefore are bet<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter conceived, then can be expreſſed in word by us, nevertheleſſe, if we can upon good ground aſſure our ſelves that we are Saints let us ſee and obſerve wherein we go beyond an hypocrite in the injoying of any ſpeciall and peculiar grace and then let us expect and look for the ſame grace in others, and whereſoever we find that bleſſed worke of grace and fruit of the good tree ingrafted into Chriſt by a lively faith we may certainly conclude he is a good tree becauſe he bringeth forth good fruit.</p>
            <p>Queſt. <hi>But the moſt holy and righteous do daily ſinne, and do that which is evill, and hypo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>crites may alſo do many good things, even works which are very good in outward appearance.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>
               <hi>Anſw.</hi> It is true indeed, but yet notwith<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtanding the evill which the Saints do, is none of their fruit nor the good that hypocrites do is none of their fruit. It cannot properly be
<pb n="72" facs="tcp:116585:41"/> called their fruit, for the fruit is that which doth diſcover the tree, either to be good or e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vill <hi>Matth.</hi> 7.16.20. <hi>Rom.</hi> 7.19.</p>
            <p>Queſt. <hi>What is then the fruit of the good tree that doth diſcover it ſelf, and prove him to be a good tree.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>
               <hi>Anſw.</hi> The fruit of the good tree ingrafted into Chriſt is manifold, but principally it is love, which hath its firſt beginning from the apprehenſion of Gods love to them, and is firſt returned to God again, and to the Lord Jeſus Chriſt next to their brethren the begotten of God, &amp; to all men even to their very enemies, doing good even to them that hate them. <hi>Mat.</hi> 5.44. 1 <hi>Joh.</hi> 4.19. <hi>Chap.</hi> 5.1.</p>
            <p>Queſt. <hi>What is the fruit of the evil tree?</hi>
            </p>
            <p>
               <hi>Anſw.</hi> It is alſo manifold, but principally it conſiſts in the contrary to this fruit of the good tree, as contempt of God and deſpiſing and hating of his truth and children.</p>
            <p>Queſt <hi>But hipocrites may diſſemble a love unto God, and to his truth and children?</hi>
            </p>
            <p>
               <hi>Anſw.</hi> It is true, but yet they cannot ſo diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſemble to make the children of God believe and account them for Saints yet they will hope the beſt of them, untill their diſſimulation be made manifeſt and they diſcovered to be evill trees.</p>
            <pb n="73" facs="tcp:116585:41"/>
            <p>Queſt. <hi>But is it poſſible to know them to be Saints of a ſudden aſſoon as they come to converſe with them?</hi>
            </p>
            <p>
               <hi>Anſw.</hi> No certainly, eſpecially in theſe times wherein we live, for no doubt corrup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion doth beare great ſway in many that no doubt are Saints, and the power of Grace doth not manifeſt it ſelf in many, by reaſon of many diſcouragements that they meet with, and for want of examples to go before them to incourage them; and therefore it is very hard to diſcern them, &amp; hence it comes to paſſe that it is held an impoſſible thing to know them in this life.</p>
            <p>Queſt. <hi>How are the company of Saints called in the Scriptures?</hi>
            </p>
            <p>
               <hi>Anſw.</hi> They are called by many honoura<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble names and titles, as the Church of Chriſt, his body his ſpouſe, his habitation, his Tem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple, <hi>Sion, Jeruſalem</hi> the pillar and ground of truth, and many ſuch like. <hi>Epheſ.</hi> 5.30. 1 <hi>Cor.</hi> 12.27. <hi>Cant.</hi> 4.8.9.10. 2 <hi>Cor.</hi> 6.16. <hi>Gal.</hi> 4.26.</p>
            <p>Queſt. <hi>When is this Church and company of Saints to be found?</hi>
            </p>
            <p>
               <hi>Anſw.</hi> This Church is diſperſed over the whole world, even amongſt the very heathen.</p>
            <p>Queſt. <hi>How can it be that there ſhould be a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny Saints in ſuch places, ſeeing they are ignorant
<pb n="74" facs="tcp:116585:42"/> of Chriſt, and there is no name under Heaven whereby we may be ſaved but onely by the name of Ieſus Chriſt?</hi> Acts 4.12.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Anſw.</hi> It is true, neither are they ſaved by any other name under heaven, but by Chriſt alone.</p>
            <p>Queſt. <hi>How can they be ſaved by him, who never came to know him, either to come, or come in the fleſh?</hi>
            </p>
            <p>
               <hi>Anſw.</hi> It may well be notwithſtanding, for there is left in man, even ſince his fall, a certaine knowledge of God, and that he is to be feared and ſerved, and there is alſo a law written in their hearts condemning of them for diſobeying the law of God, whereby they come to ſee themſelves miſerable, and to be lyable to the wrath of this juſt God, though they know not how they came to be ſo at the firſt, and alſo they ſee the goodneſſe of God extended towards them manifeſted in his crea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tures God alſo working in them by his ſpirit, perſwading them, that if they will ſeek mercy at his hands, he will be mercifull to their ſouls as well as to their bodies and this mercy of God is extended unto them for Chriſt his ſake, though they know not by whoſe meanes and for whoſe ſake they receive it. <hi>Rom.</hi> 2.14, 15.26. <hi>Acts</hi> 14.17. <hi>Rom.</hi> 1.19, 20.</p>
            <pb n="75" facs="tcp:116585:42"/>

            </p>
            <p>
               <hi>Anſw.</hi> Yes verily they have a ſpirituall communion and fellowſhip, all partaking of the ſame grace, all being begotten by one fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther, all born of water and ſpirit all partakers of one precious faith, all ruled and governed by one and the ſame holy ſpirit, who worketh in them a love to one another, though they ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver beheld the faces one of another, and do joy and rejoyce in the happineſſe and proſperi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty one of another, and for that end are dayly ſutors to God in prayer one for another. <hi>Epheſ.</hi> 2.14. <hi>Chap.</hi> 4.4.5.6.</p>
            <p>Queſt. <hi>What is the duty of the Saints being made known one to another?</hi>
            </p>
            <p>
               <hi>Anſw.</hi> Their duty is to aſſemble themſelves together in the name of Chriſt, to worſhip God, to pray unto him, and to praiſe him to exhort, comfort, and build up one another, and to rejoyce in the fellowſhip one of another, and to pray with and for one another and to miniſter comfort one unto each other both in ſpirituall and temporall things as they are able and the neceſſity of their brethren require. <hi>Heb.</hi> 10.25. <hi>Mat.</hi> 18. <hi>Iude</hi> 19.20. <hi>Heb.</hi> 13.16.</p>

            <p>Queſt. <hi>Is not this promiſe belonging to gene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rall aſſemblies that meet in publick congregati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons and may not they expect this promiſe to be performed unto them.</hi>

            <p>Queſt. <hi>But we hope that there are Saints in every publick aſsembly, doth not this promiſe of Chriſt therefore belong unto them.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>
               <hi>Anſw.</hi> It cannot be denyed, but muſt be ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>knowledged, that Chriſt will be with his peo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple in the publick aſsemblies where his true worſhip is performed, and his word truly preached yea at all times, but this promiſe of Chriſt, his preſence is a peculiar promiſe made to the Saints when they aſſemble together and agree upon any thing, to ask that may be for

            </p>
            <p>
               <hi>Anſw.</hi> He did at firſt give unto them Apo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtles, Prophets and Evangeliſts whom hee vouchſafed to make the Pen-men of the Scrip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tures, who were to be guides unto all the reſt, that were to ſucceed them, he alſo hath ordai<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned other Miniſters in his Church, as Paſtors and Teachers to bee Expoſitors of the Scrip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tures and for the applying them to the conſci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ences of the people; For the gathering toge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther of his Church, and the edifying of the bo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dy of Chriſt which are knowne and diſtingui<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhed, from the reſt of the Church, not ſo much by any outward calling by man, but by the ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cellency of gifts and graces beſtowed on them, and their faithfull employing their gifts, and diſcharge of that office that they are called un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to by Chriſt, <hi>Epheſ.</hi> 4.11. <hi>Epheſ.</hi> 4.12.</p>

            <p>Queſt. <hi>Wherein is that word of God contai<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned?</hi>
            </p>
            <p>
               <hi>Anſw.</hi> In thoſe bookes of Scripture, which we commonly call the old and new Teſtament, in which are contained many holy directions, and gracious promiſes, and conſolations, able to ſuſtaine them in the greateſt miſeries that can befall them.</p>

            <p>Queſt. <hi>What is prayer?</hi>
            </p>
            <p>
               <hi>Anſw.</hi> It is a calling upon God with the heart in the name of Chriſt Ieſus, for all law<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>full things that we ſtand in need of. <hi>Pſal.</hi> 142.2. <hi>Iohn</hi> 16.23.24.</p>
            <p>Queſt. <hi>What things are neceſsarily required in our prayer unto God?</hi>
            </p>
            <p>
               <hi>Anſw.</hi> There are theſe three things requi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red in prayer,</p>
            <p>Firſt confeſſion which is the acknowledge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment of our ſinne and miſerie, and unworthi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſſe to receive <hi>Pſal.</hi> 32.5.</p>
            <p>Secondly Petition, which is the asking of things needfull. <hi>Mat.</hi> 7.7.</p>
            <p>Thirdly thankſgiving which is the acknow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledging of his power goodneſſe and mercy, and the returning him praiſe and thanks for his former mercies beſtowed on us.</p>
            <p>Queſt. <hi>Have we any example or patterne ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cording to which we are to frame all our prayers.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>
               <hi>Anſ.</hi> Yea a moſt abſolute and perfect form given unto us by Chriſt Jeſus himſelf in the 6. of <hi>Matthew</hi> commonly called the Lords prayer.</p>
            <p>Queſt. <hi>Are we not bound therefore unto that prayer to uſe it and none but it.</hi>
            </p>
            <pb n="81" facs="tcp:116585:45"/>
            <p>
               <hi>Anſ.</hi> For the matter contained in it we are, but not the form of words, and although we may uſe the ſame words yet alſo we may by the example of the Apoſtles, uſe another form of words, and yet offend not againſt that moſt abſolute rule, ſo long as we deſire nothing, but what is therein contained.</p>
            <p>Queſt. <hi>May we joyne in prayers with thoſe that reade their prayers in a book?</hi>
            </p>
            <p>
               <hi>Anſw.</hi> Yes doubtleſſe if their prayers be good for the matter, and performed with re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verence and affection, even as well as we may with thoſe that uſe an ordinary form although they do not read it in a book or with thoſe that conceive prayer, for therein are we ſtinted as well as in joyning with them that pray out of a book, and we may inlarge our deſires in joyning with one and with the other.</p>
            <p>Queſt. <hi>When are we to uſe prayer?</hi>
            </p>
            <p>
               <hi>Anſ.</hi> At all times, upon all occaſions, we are to lift up our hearts to God by holy requeſts, e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ven in every thing we take in hand, and alſo in the publick meetings of the Saints, but there are other ſpecial times, wherein every Chriſtian hath liberty to make choice of the fitteſt time in his own wiſdome and diſcretion, as he hath need.</p>
            <p>Queſt. <hi>What is a Sacrament?</hi>
            </p>
            <pb n="82" facs="tcp:116585:46"/>
            <p>
               <hi>Anſ.</hi> A Sacrament is an outward viſible ſigne appointed by God to teach unto his peo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple ſpirituall and heavenly miſteries.</p>
            <p>Queſt. <hi>Do the Sacraments teach any other thing then that which the word of God doth?</hi>
            </p>
            <p>
               <hi>Anſ.</hi> Not any other thing is taught thereby but the very ſame thing is viſibly preached and preſented to our eyes by viſible ſignes, which we heare with our eares preached out of the word of God.</p>
            <p>Queſt. <hi>How many Sacraments are there now apointed by God continually to teach and inſtruct his Church?</hi>
            </p>
            <p>
               <hi>Anſw.</hi> Onely two, Baptiſme and the Sup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>per of the Lord. <hi>Mat.</hi> 28.19. <hi>Chap.</hi> 26..27. <hi>&amp;c.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Queſt. <hi>What is Baptiſme?</hi>
            </p>
            <p>
               <hi>Anſw.</hi> It is a teaching ſigne, whereby is vi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſibly preached unto us, by the water and the outward waſhing, Regeneration, the new birth of water and the Spirit that is Repen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tance and faith required of all that will enter into the Kingdome of Heaven. <hi>Io.</hi> 3.</p>
            <p>Queſt. <hi>Is Baptiſme neceſſary to ſalvation?</hi>
            </p>
            <p>
               <hi>Anſw.</hi> The things ſignified by the outward ſignes of water and waſhing which indeed is Baptiſme is of neceſſity to ſalvation, as our Lord teſtifieth <hi>Io.</hi> 3.5.</p>
            <pb n="83" facs="tcp:116585:46"/>
            <p>Queſt. <hi>Are not the outward ſignes of neceſſity to ſalvation?</hi>
            </p>
            <p>
               <hi>Anſw.</hi> No they are not of that neceſſity, for many no doubt may be partakers of that new birth ſignified by the outward waſhing, which never heard of the outward Baptiſme.</p>
            <p>Queſt. <hi>But what if any ſhall contemne and deſpiſe the outward Baptiſme?</hi>
            </p>
            <p>
               <hi>Anſw.</hi> It is not poſſible for any that know it to be an ordinance of God, and deſpiſe it, and will not be baptiſed, it is impoſſible for ſuch to be ſaved.</p>
            <p>Queſt. <hi>Are all the elect regenerate when they are outwardly baptiſed?</hi>
            </p>
            <p>
               <hi>An.</hi> No certainly for many of them live many yeares before that work be wrought in them, but God doth work in them that great work of Regeneration at what time it pleaſeth him.</p>
            <p>Queſt. <hi>But doth the Lord require</hi> of <hi>us to ſubmit to his own ordinance and will he not work that which is ſignified thereby?</hi>
            </p>
            <p>
               <hi>Anſw.</hi> The Lord will have us obedient to his ordinance, and it is his goodneſſe to afford unto us ſuch an excellent help, to teach and in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtruct us, &amp; to confirm unto us the truth of his promiſe by ſuch an outward viſible ſigne or ſeal, but he hath not any where promiſed that he will work that work of grace in them at that
<pb n="84" facs="tcp:116585:47"/> inſtant in their outward Baptiſme or by it.</p>
            <p>Queſt. <hi>But there are promiſes made unto Bap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiſme of eternall life, and ſuch promiſes belong to none but the regenerate therefore they are al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſo regenerate in Baptiſme.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>
               <hi>Anſw.</hi> It is true that in Scripture there are made promiſes of eternall life unto Baptiſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>me; but there are two Baptiſmes, ſpoken of in Scripture the one, men may be partakers of &amp; periſh, which is the outward waſhing and the other which is the inward waſhing, whoſoever are partakers of ſhall aſſuredly have eternall life, which is indeed the Baptiſme of the ſpirit, which whoſoever are partakers of have put on Chriſt and are buried with Chriſt, and are baptiſed into his death, and ſo ſhall alſo live with Chriſt in eternall glory.</p>
            <p>Queſt. <hi>May Infants be baptiſed, ſeeing they cannot underſtand what is done or meant by Bap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiſme?</hi>
            </p>
            <p>
               <hi>Anſw.</hi> Yes doubtleſſe they may as well as children might bee circumciſed, both Sacrament ſignifying one and the ſame thing, and therefore they being as capable of the thing ſignified now, as they were then, may be baptiſed for the Lord would thereby ſhew unto us that we are all born polluted and defiled, our nature being corrupted, and that children
<pb n="85" facs="tcp:116585:47"/> have need of that inward waſhing of the ſpirit ſignified by outward Baptiſme, and al ſo to teach us that Infants may be ſaved as well as o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thers ſeeing he would admit them to be parta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>kers of that his ordinance.</p>
            <p>Queſt. <hi>Whhat is the Sacrament of the Lords Supper?</hi>
            </p>
            <p>
               <hi>Anſw.</hi> It is alſo an outward ſigne whereby is repreſented unto us by the breaking of the Bread, and the pouring out of the Wine the Lords death the breaking of his body and the pouring out of his blood and by the receiving of thoſe ſignes of Bread and Wine is ſet forth unto us the participation and communion of the faithfull in his death and in whatſoever he hath done for them and it is their thankfull re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>membrance thereof till he come, 1 <hi>Cor.</hi> 11.</p>
            <p>Queſt. <hi>Who are to partake of this Sacrament?</hi>
            </p>
            <p>
               <hi>Anſw.</hi> It was inſtituted onely for the Saints, who are ingrafted into Jeſus Chriſt by a true and lively faith: and for their comfort a one.</p>
            <p>Queſt. <hi>May not others bee admitted to this Sacrament?</hi>
            </p>
            <p>
               <hi>Anſw.</hi> They ought not to be admitted if they be knowne to bee wicked, and contemners of good things, and indeed they ought not to pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſume to eat thereof, conſidering the danger and damage that comes by unworthy eating
<pb n="86" facs="tcp:116585:48"/> and drinking thereof, 1 <hi>Cor.</hi> 11.28.29.</p>
            <p>Queſt. <hi>What is the danger in unworthy eating, and drinking thereof?</hi>
            </p>
            <p>
               <hi>Anſw.</hi> They provoke the Lord to lay judge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments upon them, for abuſing his ordinance, which was ordained onely for the helpe and comfort of the faithfull, and ſo eat and drinke damnation to themſelves, 1 <hi>Cor.</hi> 11.</p>
            <p>Queſt. <hi>What great things hath the Scriptures foretold us, that are yet unfulfilled the perfor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mance whereof wee are to expect in theſe latter dayes?</hi>
            </p>
            <p>
               <hi>Anſw.</hi> The deſtruction of Antichriſt, that man of Sinne; The reſtoration of the truth from thoſe errors abroad in the world the comming downe of the Turkes upon the Chriſtians, and the comming of the Lord unto Judgement, 2 <hi>Theſ.</hi> 2.8. <hi>Revel.</hi> 21.11. <hi>chap.</hi> 1.17.16. <hi>chap.</hi> 18. <hi>Rev.</hi> 20.8, 9. <hi>Ezek.</hi> 38.2. and <hi>chapt.</hi> 39.1.</p>
            <p>Queſt. <hi>Is the time of the deſtruction of Anti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chriſt layd downe in the Scriptures?</hi>
            </p>
            <p>
               <hi>Anſw.</hi> Yes certainly.</p>
            <p>Queſt. <hi>But is it poſſible to find out the time of his deſtruction?</hi>
            </p>
            <p>
               <hi>Anſw.</hi> Yes aſſuredly, for the Lord hath cau<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſed it to bee written for that end, that the Church of God might know it, and might reape the greater comfort thereby, in not one<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
<pb n="87" facs="tcp:116585:48"/> knowing, that he ſhall be deſtroyed, but alſo in knowing the yeare of his deſtruction, they may have their mindes ſetled and patiently wait, and not doubt the fulfilling of that pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miſe concerning his deſtruction.</p>
            <p>Queſt. <hi>But is not times and ſeaſons, onely knowne unto the Lord?</hi>
            </p>
            <p>
               <hi>Anſw.</hi> Times and ſeaſons are known alſo to the Church, when it pleaſeth God to reveale them for the comfort of his people as we may ſee that the time of deliverance of <hi>Iſrael</hi> out of the captivity in <hi>Babilon</hi> was revealed and made known unto <hi>Daniel,</hi> which he found out by books that were written.</p>
            <p>Queſt. <hi>In what place of Scripture is the time of Antichriſts deſtruction layd downe?</hi>
            </p>
            <p>
               <hi>Anſw.</hi> In the booke of the <hi>Revelation</hi> and the eleventh chapter, where hee is limited to raigne forty two moneths, which is moneths of yeares, which amounteth to 1260 yeares; The end of which time ſhall bee in the yeare 1666. as appeareth in the laſt verſe of the thir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teenth chapter, where the very period and fi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nall determination of Antichriſt is layd down, in which yeare the deſtruction denounced a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainſt him ſhall fall on him.</p>
            <p>Queſt. <hi>Shall there not be a reſtoration of the truth till the deſtruction of Antichriſt?</hi>
            </p>
            <pb n="88" facs="tcp:116585:49"/>
            <p>
               <hi>Anſw.</hi> The truth hath begun to appeare al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ready, and ſtill ſhall more and more; but the full reſtauration thereof ſhall not bee till all the darkneſſe of Antichriſt bee removed, and his deſtruction accompliſhed <hi>Revel.</hi> 11.11.</p>
            <p>Queſt. <hi>Is not the truth fully knowne publiſhed, preached, and profeſſed now at this time in thoſe Kingdomes, where Antichriſts power is abo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liſhed?</hi>
            </p>
            <p>
               <hi>Anſw.</hi> No certainly much darkneſſe ſtill re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>maines even amongſt them and great confuſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on, which ſhall at that time be more fully diſco<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vered, and the truth made knowne, and errors and Hereſies aboliſhed by ſuch whom the Lord ſhall raiſe up, in and about that time, and for that end.</p>
            <p>Queſt. <hi>Are we not to expect the truth to bee more fully diſcovered, then now it is, before the deſtruction of Antichriſt.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>
               <hi>Anſw.</hi> Yes aſſuredly for it is the light of the truth maintained by the Saints, which ſhall in a ſpeciall manner aboliſh Antichriſts dark<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſſe, and alſo ſhall be the greateſt meanes of his deſtruction: for the people of God ſhall by the light of the truth more, fully diſcover his abominations, and cauſe the Princes of the earth to ſee how groſſely they have been delu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded and abuſed by him, and ſo they ſhall with
<pb n="89" facs="tcp:116585:49"/> one conſent, ſet themſelves againſt this great enemy of Chriſt to roote him out and to exe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cute the judgement that the Lord hath denoun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ced againſt him, <hi>Revel.</hi> 19.11, 12, 13, 14, 15. <hi>Rev.</hi> 17.16.</p>
            <p>Queſt. <hi>Shall the Church of God enjoy any great proſperity after the deſtruction of Anti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chriſt?</hi>
            </p>
            <p>
               <hi>Anſw.</hi> Yes certainly, for then they ſhall be freed from their great and violent oppreſſions, and have free liberty to profeſſe and practiſe the whole will of God, and enjoy the commu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nion and fellowſhip one of another, their in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ward graces ſhall be great, and excellent their love ſhall abound one towards another, conti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nually rejoycing in the hope of that crowne of glory, which is layd up for them in heaven, 4 <hi>Eſdras</hi> 11.46. and <hi>chap.</hi> 12.34. 2 <hi>Tim.</hi> 4.8. <hi>Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vel.</hi> 19.1.2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7.</p>
            <p>Queſt. <hi>Shall the whole Nation of the Jewes be converted, and receive the Goſpell of Chriſt, before the comming of the Lord to judgement?</hi>
            </p>
            <p>
               <hi>Anſw.</hi> We hope many of them ſhall be called before that day; But that the whole Nation ſhall be called and receive the Goſpell, we have no ground in Scripture ſo to thinke.</p>
            <p>Queſt. <hi>But the Apoſtle in the eleventh chap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter to the Romans ſeemes to intend to prove that
<pb n="90" facs="tcp:116585:50"/> they ſhall all be called before the day of the Lord?</hi>
            </p>
            <p>
               <hi>Anſw.</hi> Whoſoever do ſo collect and gather from that chapter doe miſunderſtand and miſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>interpret the Apoſtle, for his purpoſe is not to prove that all the Nation of the Jewes ſhall be called to Chriſt, in the latter end of the world; but to ſhew unto the Gentiles (leſt they ſhould wax proud againſt the Jewes) that God had a people amongſt the Jewes, and that hee had not caſt them all away, but that hee had a remnant according to the election of Grace, even amongſt <hi>Abrahams</hi> naturall ſeed, whom he would call, when it pleaſed him; many were called in <hi>Pauls</hi> time, and no doubt but many ſince that time, and we hope that yet there are many of them that belong to the Lord, which ſhall be called when the darkneſſe of Antichriſt is expelled, and the light of the truth appeareth and ſhineth by the Church, but wee are not to expect any ſuch generall calling of them.</p>
            <p>Queſt. <hi>Doth not the Apoſtle ſay in the</hi> 26th <hi>verſe of that thapter, that all Iſrael ſhall be ſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ved; Is not here therefore a ſure ground to build upon, for their converſion to Chriſt?</hi>
            </p>
            <p>
               <hi>Anſ.</hi> The Apoſtle there meanes by all Iſraell, all the elect of God, both Jews and Gentiles, and not onely the Nation of the Jewes, as may be proved by theſe Reaſons;</p>
            <pb n="91" facs="tcp:116585:50"/>
            <p>Firſt, becauſe the Apoſtle ſaith in the twenty fift verſe that in part blindneſſe, or hardneſſe is happened unto Iſraell untill the fulneſſe of the Gentils be come in which is even till the com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ming of the Lord to Judgement, as appeareth, <hi>Luke</hi> 21.24. Therefore by all Iſraell is not meant the Jewes onely but all the elect of the Jewes, and of the Gentiles.</p>
            <p>Secondly, becauſe the Promiſe of the deli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verer in the Teſtimony of <hi>Eſay</hi> alleadged, by the Apoſtle, was made to the Elect Gentiles, as well as to the Elect Jewes, and the elect Gen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiles, reape the ſame benefit by the Deliverer; And this promiſe alſo pertaines to none, but to the Elect of the Jewes and Gentiles, not to all the carnall Jewes, but onely to the elect, the Spirituall ſeed of <hi>Abraham,</hi> conſiſting both of Jewes and Gentiles; For the teſt doe not reap this benefit, namely, to have their ungodlineſſe turned away, <hi>Eſay</hi> 59.20. <hi>Rom.</hi> 9.6.7.8. <hi>Rom.</hi> 2.28.29, <hi>Gal.</hi> 3.29.</p>
            <p>Thirdly, (by all Iſraell) cannot bee meant, that in the latter dayes, all the Nation of the Jewes ſhall bee converted; Becauſe this great calling, which is pretended to be, is not once mentioned in the booke of the <hi>Revelation,</hi> and therefore not ſhewed unto <hi>Iohn,</hi> and yet he was taken up, and was promiſed to have ſhewne
<pb n="92" facs="tcp:116585:51"/> unto him the things which ſhould be hereaf<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter, <hi>Revelation</hi> 4.1. But this great converſion of the Jewes; he ſaw not, and yet hee ſaw all things to the ſetting up of the new <hi>Jeruſalem,</hi> in everlaſting glory and beauty, therefore cer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tainly we are not to expect any ſuch matter, neither in this place doth the holy Ghoſt in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tend any ſuch thing.</p>
            <p>Queſt. <hi>But it may ſeeme that this promiſe is made onely to the Iewes, becauſe is made to</hi> Ja<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cob, <hi>and they only are the poſterity and ſeed of</hi> Jacob?</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Anſw.</hi> It is not made only to the naturall Jewes, for we are to know, that when any ſuch ſpeciall promiſe is made in Scripture, of turn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing away ungodlineſſe, and taking away of ſins from <hi>Iſrael</hi> or <hi>Iacob,</hi> that promiſe is made and intended, as well to the Elect Gentiles, as to the Elect Jewes, even to all <hi>Abrahams</hi> ſpiritu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>all ſeed which are called by thoſe names of <hi>Iſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rael</hi> and <hi>Iacob</hi> who although they be Gentiles in the fleſh, yet indeed are Jewes in Spirit and truth, <hi>Rom.</hi> 2.29. And <hi>Abrahams,</hi> ſeed and Heires according to the promiſe; <hi>Gal.</hi> 3.29.</p>
            <p>Queſt. <hi>What then may be the miſtery that the Apoſtle ſpeakes of in the</hi> 25 <hi>verſe of that eleventh chapter to the Romans?</hi>
            </p>
            <p>
               <hi>Anſw.</hi> The miſtery is Gods giving ſome up
<pb n="93" facs="tcp:116585:51"/> to hardneſſe and blindneſſe, and his giving Grace unto others, at the conſideration where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>of, the Apoſtle breakes forth into admiration in the 33 verſe, ſaying, <hi>O the depth of the riches, both of the wiſdome, and knowledge of God, how unſearchable are his judgements, and his wayes paſt finding out,</hi> Rom. 11.33.34.35.36.</p>
            <p>Queſt. <hi>But all the Prophets have propheſied of the returne of</hi> Iſrael, <hi>and of his reſtouration, to ſuch an excellent eſtate of glory and happineſſe and freedome from evill, as they never yet enjoyed, are we not now therefore to expect it in theſe latter dayes?</hi>
            </p>
            <p>
               <hi>Anſw.</hi> Whatſoever the Prophets have pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pheſied to be fulfilled, and is not yet performed we are to expect; But wee are to know that thoſe ſpeciall promiſes, are made only to the Elect, and to all the Elect, when they ſhall all be gathered together, and delivered from all their Captivities and ſorrowes, which Reſtau<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ration of Iſrael is not to be expected of us to be performed untill the comming of the Lord unto Judgement as appeareth, <hi>Acts</hi> 3.21.</p>
            <p>Queſt. <hi>But the Prophets doe ſpeake of bring<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing them into their owne Land againe, even the promiſed land: therefore it muſt needs be in this life?</hi>
            </p>
            <p>
               <hi>Anſw.</hi> That doth not follow, for they ſhall be
<pb n="94" facs="tcp:116585:52"/> brought into their owne Land, and enjoy it for ever and ever, even that Land which was pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miſed to <hi>Abraham, Iſaac,</hi> and <hi>Jacob,</hi> and all their ſpirituall ſeed, and they ſhall poſſeſſe it for ever, not as it is now earthly and the curſe remaining upon it, but after it ſhall be purged, and the curſe taken away and made a heavenly habitation, fit for <hi>Abraham</hi> himſelfe (to whom it was firſt promiſed, and never yet performed unto him, but ſhall bee then made good unto him) and for all his ſpirituall ſeed to dwell in for evermore.</p>
            <p>Queſt. <hi>But where this reſtoration is promiſed, there is mention made of Building of houſes and planting of Vineyards, eating and drinking,</hi> &amp;c. <hi>which cannot be after this life?</hi> Eſay 65.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Anſw.</hi> We know not what is intended by ſuch like things, nor what ſhall be at that day, nor what theſe things may adde to our happi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſſe; And therefore being ignorant of theſe things, let not us wreſt the Scripture out of the way, to frame a meaning which the Lord neuer intended, becauſe we imagine that theſe things cannot be after this life; And wee are alſo to conſider that in many places where this Reſto<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ration of Iſrael is promiſed there are alſo ſuch things ſpoken of, as cannot be expected in this life, as namely, that there ſhall be no ſorrow,
<pb n="95" facs="tcp:116585:52"/> no mourning, nor death, nor that any uncleane thing ſhall enter amongſt them.</p>
            <p>Queſt. <hi>You ſaid before that the Church of God after the deſtruction of the great Antichriſt, ſhould enjoy much proſperity and peace, ſhall they then have no enemies?</hi>
            </p>
            <p>
               <hi>Anſw.</hi> Yes aſſuredly, the true Church of God ſhall never want enemies to try them, and to exerciſe their patience, but they ſhall be freed for a time, from thoſe great and violent perſecutions, which they did ſuffer, during the long and tedious Raigne of the great Anti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chriſt of <hi>Roma,</hi> who ſought by all meanes, to root out all the ſeed and generation of the Church.</p>
            <p>Queſt. <hi>Shall this their peace and proſperity long continue?</hi>
            </p>
            <p>
               <hi>Anſw.</hi> No verily, for the devill ſhall ſtirre up other enemies, <hi>Gog</hi> and <hi>Magog,</hi> the Kings of the Eaſt, even the Turke and his adherents, and they ſhall envy the proſperity of the Church and ſhall come down upon the Chri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtian Nations, and compaſſe about the Tents of the Saints, and the beloved City and to ſeeke to root out her name from off the earth <hi>Ezek.</hi> 38.10.11.12. <hi>Revel.</hi> 20.8.9.</p>
            <p>Queſt. <hi>What will bee the effect of this his malice?</hi>
            </p>
            <pb n="96" facs="tcp:116585:53"/>
            <p>
               <hi>Amſw.</hi> He ſhall cauſe through his cruelty many to fall away from the profeſſion of the truth of Chriſt: to Mahometiſme or heathe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niſme ſo that the Sunne ſhall be darkened even Chriſt himſelf and his truth ſhall be obſcured and his glory darkned.</p>
            <p>And the Moon, that is the States and princes of the world ſhall not give their light of help and comfort and protection of the church by their powers they being beaten down by the power of theſe great adverſaries,</p>
            <p>And the ſtars <hi>&amp;c.</hi> (that is the Miniſters and preachers of Chriſt) ſhall ſall from heaven that is, from the Church, even to Mahometiſme or heatheniſme, all which hath been foretold us by the Lordhimſelf in <hi>Matthew</hi> 24. <hi>verſe</hi> 29,</p>
            <p>Queſt. What ſhall follow <hi>thereupon?</hi>
            </p>
            <p>
               <hi>Anſw.</hi> God himſelfe will tight for his peo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple wonderfully, and will conſume and deſtroy all thoſe enemies by fire from heaven, and de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liver his Church from all her enemies <hi>Revel.</hi> 20.19.</p>

               <hi>Anſw.</hi> Yes certainly, but not as it is now corrupt but When all things that came in by reaſon of the curſe for mans ſinne, ſhall be re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>moved and taken away quite, and all things be made new, for nothing that came in with the curſe can abide there where Chriſt hath his Kingdome and throne of glory.</p>
            <p>Queſt. <hi>But the Apoſtle</hi> Peter <hi>ſaith</hi> 2 <hi>Pet.</hi> 3.10. <hi>that the Earth and the works there ſhall be burnt up, and all things here below ſhall be diſsol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ved?</hi>

            <p>
               <hi>Anſw.</hi> True it is that whatſoever came in with the Curſe ſhall bee diſſolved and burnt up, and all taken away, and nothing thereof ſhall remain, but onely what was cre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ated before the curſe, and all things ſhall be made new, as in the firſt crearion of them and far more excellent and durable as the ſame A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſtle ſaith <hi>we look for net heavers and a new earth, according to his promiſe wherein dwel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leth righteouſnes.</hi>

            <p>
               <hi>Anſw.</hi> In the 65. Chapter of <hi>Iſaiah</hi> where the promiſe is made and ſet downe in plaine words.</p>
            <pb n="100" facs="tcp:116585:55"/>
            <p>Queſt. <hi>But ſhall not the happineſſe of the Saints be for ever in heaven for the Apoſtle</hi> Pe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter <hi>ſaith, that the inheritance of the Saints is re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſerved in heaven and</hi> Paul <hi>ſaith,</hi> we have an houſe not made with hands, but eternall in the heavens. 1 <hi>Pet.</hi> 14. 2 <hi>Cor.</hi> 5.1.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Anſw.</hi> True it is, that the inheritance of the Saints is reſerved in heaven, and it is eter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nall, but this that is reſerved in heaven, ſhall come down from heaven Chriſt himſelfe will bring with him that new <hi>Ieruſalem</hi> and cloath his ſaints with that houſe which is from heaven which was ſo deſired by the Apoſtle Paul 2 <hi>Cor.</hi> 5.2. the beauty and glory of that eſtate is ſet forth in the 21 chapter of the <hi>Revelation</hi> which ſhall be ſo great that the heart of man can de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſire no more, for there ſhall be a fulneſſe of all things.</p>
            <p>Queſt. <hi>But what places of Scripture do prove that the Saints ſhall have their glory and happi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſse upon this earth?</hi>
            </p>
            <p>
               <hi>Anſw.</hi> There are many places of Scripture to this purpoſe and I will inſtance ſome of them; and firſt I will begin with the promiſe of God made unto <hi>Abraham</hi> concerning the land of <hi>Canaan,</hi> it was promiſed to him and to his ſeed for ever. <hi>Gen.</hi> 13.15. <hi>Chap.</hi> 15.17. But <hi>Abra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ham</hi> never yet enjoyed the fulfilling of that
<pb n="101" facs="tcp:116585:55"/> promiſe, therefore at that great day of the Lord, it ſhall be made good unto him and his ſeed for ever, for it was given unto him for an everlaſting poſſeſſion. <hi>Gen.</hi> 7.18.</p>
            <p>Queſt. <hi>But</hi> Abraham <hi>ſeed after four hundred yeares did poſseſse that land, was not then the pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miſe fulfilled to</hi> Abraham?</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Anſw.</hi> No aſſuredly there was a further ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tent in that promiſe then was performed un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to his naturall ſeed, and that was but a type of the great poſſeſſion that ſhould be given to him and his ſpirituall ſeed for ever. <hi>Gen.</hi> 17.8.</p>
            <p>Queſt. <hi>What is the next Scripture that proves the Saints eternall happines to be on this earth.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>
               <hi>An.</hi> The next is <hi>Matth.</hi> 5.5. <hi>Bleſsed are the meek, for they ſhall inherit the earth,</hi> and <hi>Pſal.</hi> 37.11. <hi>But the meek ſhall inherit the earth, and ſhall delight themſelves in the abundance of peace.</hi> Which promiſes muſt needs be underſtood of the life to come and not of this life for they are promiſes for the time to come, and not of the time preſent, for we know by experience that the meek do not now in this life inherit the earth; but this promiſe ſhall be performed un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to them at that great day of the reſtauration of all things.</p>
            <p>Queſt. <hi>What is the next Scripture to prove this?</hi>
            </p>
            <pb n="102" facs="tcp:116585:56"/>
            <p>
               <hi>Anſw.</hi> The next is <hi>Revelation</hi> the 5. and the 10. <hi>ver.</hi> the ſweet ſong of thankſgiving of the 24 Elders, the latter part whereof is their ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>knowledgement in theſe words and haſt made unto us our God Kings and prieſts and we ſhall raign on the earth; which is ſpoken of the time to come and not of the time preſent, for now is not their time of reigning but of ſuffering.</p>
            <p>Queſt. <hi>What other Scripture is there to prove this point?</hi>
            </p>
            <p>
               <hi>Anſw.</hi> Out of the 11 <hi>chap.</hi> of the <hi>Revelation ver.</hi> the 15. where after the ſounding of the ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>venth trumpet there were great voyces heard in heaven, ſaying. <hi>The Kingdomes of this world are become the Kingdomes of our Lord and of his Chriſt, and he ſhall reigne for ever and ever,</hi> as alſo <hi>Dan.</hi> 7.14.27. So that then Chriſt ſhall reigne as King upon this earth, and all powers ſhall ſerve and obey him for evermore.</p>
            <p>Queſt. <hi>But if the Saints glory and happines ſhall be upon this earth it will be conceived that it cannot be ſo great, glorious and excellent as is ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pected to be, and as the Scripture ſets it forth to be, and for the moſt part of our preachers they do tell us that it ſhall be in the higheſt heavens?</hi>
            </p>

               <hi>Anſw.</hi> For the happineſſe and felicity of the Saints which they enjoy, it ſhall be ſo great ſo glorious, ſo excellent, although upon this earth

            <p>Queſt. <hi>But what is the reaſon they conceive ſo, that the glory and happineſſe of the Saints ſhall be in the higheſt heavens?</hi>
            </p>
            <p>
               <hi>Anſw.</hi> I know no Scripture that tends there unto, beſides thoſe I have already anſwe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red or ſome ſuch it may be like them, but their error and miſunderſtanding of the Scripture lies in this, that they take and expound thoſe places of Scripture that intend and ſet forth the happineſſe of the Saints for ever, to be in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tended and meant of a great converſion of the
<pb n="104" facs="tcp:116585:57"/> naturall Jewes to be brought into the land of <hi>Canaan</hi> againe before the coming of Chriſt to Judgement which opinion turnes them from the truth, and hereby the Saints are deprived of many ſweet promiſes that are made unto them for their comfort here in this life in the expectation of that glory and happineſſe there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>in ſet forth, and promiſed unto them then which a greater wrong cannot be done to the people of God.</p>
            <p>Queſt. <hi>You ſaid the Scriptures are plentifull in expreſſing the happines of the Saints for ever upon this earth, I pray you give me thoſe places of Scriptures, and ſet down the ſeverall texts, that we may examine them and rejoyce in the expecta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of them and ſo I ſhall conclude for this time and ceaſe from demanding any more queſtions of you.</hi>

               <hi>Anſw.</hi> I ſhall willingly do it according to my abi ity, but yet it is not poſſible for me to find out all thoſe ſweet promiſes contained in the Scriptures yet as many as I can call to mind for the preſent I will ſet down, that hereafter we may read them and take comfort in them, and live by faith in the hope and expectation of them, and the Lord inlighten our under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtandings in the knowledge of his truth, and give us hearts to obey the truth made knowne
<pb n="105" facs="tcp:116585:57"/> unto us, that God may be glorified by us, through Jeſus Chriſt, by the aſſiſtance of the Holy Ghoſt to whom be all praiſe, glory, and honour, for ever <hi>Amen.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>The places of Scripture are theſe following, But for your better underſtanding of them, I pray you conſider the words of the Holy Ghoſt by Saint <hi>Peter,</hi> in the 3 of the <hi>Acts verſe</hi> 21. in theſe words, ſpeaking there of Jeſus Chriſt whom the heaven muſt receive untill the times of reſtitution of alll things which God hath ſpoken by the mouth of all his holy pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phets ſince the world began, ſo that you may obſerve hence that this reſtitution or reſtaura<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion muſt not be til the ſecond coming of Chriſt and then it ſhall be and it is that which all the Prophets have ſpoken of, and if theſe places of Scripture here following do not intend this great reſtitution, then let them who are con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trary minded ſhow us where it is ſpoken of in the Scriptures, if they will needs have us to underſtand theſe Scriptures to intend the great converſion of the naturall Jewes, now in the latter end of the world, and before the coming of Chriſt to Judgement; a doctrine never inten<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded or meant by the Holy Ghoſt for this re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtitution is not to be till the ſecond coming of Chriſt, <hi>Act,</hi> 3, 19.20, 21. And ſo I may now leave
<pb facs="tcp:116585:58"/> you to the reading of the Scriptures here fol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lowing, the Lord give us wiſdome to under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtand them aright, and to find and feele the comfort of them, for they belong to all <hi>Abra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hams</hi> ſpirituall ſeed, as well Gentiles as Jewes, and not to the naturall Jew, except he be alſo a Jew inward. <hi>Rom.</hi> 2.28.29.</p>

            <p>CChriſtian Reader it may be thought that I have not beene ſo large in this last matter concerning the happineſſe of the Saints in glory for ever with Chriſt their Lord and King upon this earth as the matter required, and therefore for thy more full ſatisfaction in the ſame J referre thee to a book called the <hi>land of promiſe and the cove<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nant thereof</hi> printed <hi>1641</hi> for <hi>John Wright</hi> the younger in the old <hi>Baily,</hi> wherein this thing is fully manifeſted it being the ſubject matter of the whole book and proved by many places of Scripture, for indeed the Scriptures are very plentifull in this thing, it being that which God chiefly intended from all eternity it being the reſt of God, wherein he alwayes took delight and pleaſure, the ſetting up of the Kingdome of his Sonne Chriſt, and his dwelling with the Sons of men his Saints for e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vermore, even the full perfection of all his works which he entended from everlaſting.</p>
